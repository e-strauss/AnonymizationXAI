{"text": "Geoffrey Harber Diggle (6 December 1902 \u2013 13 February 1993) was a British chess player and writer. Diggle contributed articles to the British Chess Magazine (BCM) from 1933 to 1981, and to the British Chess Federation's publications Newsflash and Chess Moves from 1974 to 1992. C.H.O'D. Alexander called Diggle \\\"one of the best writers on chess that I know\\\". In his A Book of Chess, Alexander reproduced in toto Diggle's account, first published in the November and December 1943 BCM, of the de facto 1843 world championship match between Staunton and St. Amant. After Diggle told Alexander of a game he had lost in seven moves (1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Bxf7+?! Kxf7 5.Nxe4 Nc6 6.Qf3+ Kg8?? 7.Ng5! 1-0 Davids-Diggle, London Banks League 1949), Alexander affectionately christened Diggle \\\"the Badmaster\\\", a facetious counterpoint to the more familiar title Grandmaster. Diggle later adopted the sobriquet as a pseudonym, writing a series of articles in Newsflash under that name between 1974 and 1986. Chess historian Edward Winter wrote the following in his remembrance of Diggle in CHESS magazine: Specializing in nineteenth-century chess history (particularly the Staunton period), he brought the old masters to life with rare wit and shrewdness. These qualities also permeated his accounts of the idiosyncratic doings and sayings of club \\\"characters\\\", such as the elderly player \\\"who fumbled his way to perdition at reasonable speed until he was a queen and two minor pieces to the bad, after which he discovered that 'every move demanded the nicest calculation'\\\", or \\\"the Lincoln bottom board of 1922, who complained that he had 'lost his queen about the third move and couldn\u2019t seem to get going after that'.\\\"A former county champion, G.H.D. was charmingly self-deprecatory in his reminiscences, as when he had a game adjudicated by Tartakower: \\\"The Great Master, having been fetched, sat down at the board very simply and unaffectedly, and drank in through his spectacles the fruits (and probably the whole deplorable history) of the Badmaster\u2019s afternoon strategy.\\\"Little escaped G.H.D.'s eye, even towards the end. Modestly adapting Oscar Wilde, he claimed to have \\\"nothing to declare but his longevity\\\", simply adding that he had \\\"mingled from time to time with three generations of eminent players ranging from Isidor Gunsberg to Nigel Short, and rambled extensively round the highways and byways of provincial chess\\\". He was one of the game's most stylish chroniclers. In 1984 and 1987, Chess Notes published two collections of Diggle's Newsflash articles as Chess Characters: Reminiscences of a Badmaster and Chess Characters: Reminiscences of a Badmaster, Volume II.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "ChessPlayer", "wiki_name": "G._H._Diggle", "word_count": 423, "label": "Chess Player", "people": "G.

Born in Eindhoven, Netherlands, Aerts began training in Muay Thai and kickboxing at the age of fourteen. He won his first world title when he was nineteen years old in 1990, taking the International Kick Boxing Federation's Heavyweight Championship. He would also add the Dutch heavyweight title the World Muay Thai Association's heavyweight title to his mantlepiece before going on to compete in the K-1 organization in Japan. He has competed in every K-1 World Grand Prix except one (2009), which has led to him being referred to as \\\"Mr. K-1\\\". A three-time K-1 World Grand Prix Champion, he debuted at the inaugural K-1 World GP in 1993 where he was eliminated by fellow K-1 legend Ernesto Hoost. He won his first Grand Prix in 1994 by knocking out Rob van Esdonk and Patrick Smith in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively, before taking a unanimous decision over Masaaki Satake in the final. Aerts also won the GP the following year when he beat Toshiyuki Atokawa by KO, Ernesto Hoost by decision and then stopped J\u00e9r\u00f4me Le Banner with body shots in the final. He would not win the tournament again until 1998 when he KO'd all three of his opponents in front of 63,800 spectators at the Tokyo Dome. In what is considered to be one of the best Grands Prix ever, and the pinnacle of Aerts' career, he stopped Masaaki Satake with a knee strike in the quarters and forced the referee to stop his semi-final match with long-time rival Mike Bernardo. In one of the most significant moments in K-1 history, he knocked out Andy Hug with one of his famous high kicks in the final. He won this tournament in six minutes and forty-three seconds, which was the quickest K-1 GP win ever at the time. This record stood until 2009 when it was beaten by Semmy Schilt.

Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local High Street Cafe. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing, and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton, to open Nutters of Savile Row at No 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, Managing Director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of The Beatles' album Abbey Road in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims. In the 1970s his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976 Sexton bought Nutter out of the Business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the row with a ready to wear shop: \\\"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\\\". (This new venture, which traded at No 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \\\"Tommy Nutter\\\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \\\"cross between the big-shouldered Miami Vice look and the authentic Savile Row.\\\" He created the clothing of The Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman.

{"text": "William Henry Krause Pollock (21 February 1859 in Cheltenham \u2013 5 October 1896 in Clifton, England) was an English chess master, and a surgeon. Pollock was born in Cheltenham, England, the son of the Rev. William J. Pollock. He was educated at Clifton College. He studied for the medical profession in Dublin, Ireland from 1880\u201382, at which time he was a member of the Dublin Chess Club. In 1882, he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin. In the same year, his first published chess game and problem appeared in the unlikely setting of the Irish publication The Practical Farmer. After receiving his medical license, Pollock moved back to England and became a surgeon. Pollock tied for 1st\u20133rd in the B section at Bath 1884, scoring 7 points out of 10 games. In a stronger tournament, the British Chess Association Congress held at London 1885, he finished 4th with 10\u00bd/15, behind Isidor Gunsberg, Henry Edward Bird and Anthony Guest. He tied for 8\u201310th in the Master Tournament at Hereford, scoring 3/10; Blackburne won, ahead of Bird and Schallop. In the British Chess Club Master Tourney (London 1886), he finished 5th of 8 players, scoring 3/7, behind Blackburne, Bird, Gunsberg, and James Mason. In the 2nd British Chess Federation Championship, also held at London 1886, he finished 10th of 13 players (4\u00bd/12), but had the consolation of handing tournament winner Blackburne one of his two losses. At Nottingham 1886, he finished 7th of 10 players (3/9), behind Burn, Schallopp, Gunsberg, Johannes Zukertort, Bird, and Jean Taubenhaus. He tied for 3rd\u20135th of 7 players (3/6) at Stamford 1887, won by Joseph Henry Blake. At London 1887, the 3rd British Chess Federation Congress, he finished 5th of 10 players (4/9), behind Burn, Gunsberg, Blackburne, and Zukertort. At Bradford 1888, the 4th British Chess Federation Championship, he tied with Bird for 9th\u201310th place out of 17 players (7/16); Gunsberg won. He tied for 5\u20136th of 10 players at London 1888 (Simpson's Divan), also won by Gunsberg. Pollock returned to Ireland to win the Irish Championship at Dublin 1885 with 9 out of 10 points. He won Belfast 1886 (ahead of Joseph Henry Blackburne and Amos Burn) with a rare perfect score of 8\u20130. He took 2nd at Dublin 1889. In 1889 Pollock made the voyage to New York City to participate in the great New York international tournament, the Sixth American Chess Congress. One of the longest tournaments in history, this double round robin was intended to select a challenger for the world championship title held by William Steinitz. Pollock finished 11th out of 20 players; Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss won. He later moved to Baltimore as the resident chess professional, and soon was writing a chess column for the Baltimore Sunday News, as well as reports on American chess for the British Chess Magazine. In 1890, he won a match against Charles Moehle 7\u00bd\u20136\u00bd in New York, took 2nd place at the St. Louis Chess Congress, and played in Chicago. He lost a match to Eugene Delmar 3\u20135 at Skaneateles 1891, shared 1st with Jackson Showalter but lost a playoff game at Lexington 1891. In 1892, he was Wilhelm Steinitz's secretary. At tournaments in New York in 1893, he tied for 4\u20135th, and tied for 9\u201311th in New York (Emanuel Lasker won). In early 1895, he drew a match in Montreal against George H. D. Gossip, each player winning six games with five draws. This result was likely more satisfactory to Gossip than to Pollock, given Gossip's status as a perennial last-place finisher in major tournaments. Later that year, Pollock represented Canada at the famous Hastings 1895 chess tournament, won by Harry Nelson Pillsbury. Pollock took 19th (out of 22), including wins over the 4th and 5th-place finishers Siegbert Tarrasch and Wilhelm Steinitz. Following the tournament, Pollock's health progressively deteriorated due to tuberculosis. In August 1896, he returned to England, where he died at his father's home in Clifton on 5 October 1896.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "ChessPlayer", "wiki_name": "William_H._K._Pollock", "word_count": 665, "label": "Chess Player", "people": "William H.

{"text": "Joseph Salim Peress (1896 \u2013 June 4, 1978), was a pioneering British diving engineer, inventor of one of the first truly usable atmospheric diving suits, the Tritonia, and was involved in the construction of the famous JIM suit. Salim Peress grew up in the Middle East. It is said that his interest in diving suit design started from the observations of the Persian Gulf pearl divers. Peress had a natural talent for engineering design, and had challenged himself to construct an articulated atmospheric diving suit (ADS) that would keep divers dry and at atmospheric pressure, even at great depth. At the time, little was known about decompression diving. Various atmospheric suits had been developed during the Victorian era, but nobody had yet managed to overcome the basic design problem of constructing a joint which would remain flexible and watertight at depth without seizing up under pressure. In 1918 Peress began working for WG Tarrant at Byfleet, United Kingdom, where he was given the space and tools to develop his ideas about constructing an ADS. His first attempt was an immensely complex prototype machined from solid stainless steel. In 1923 Peress was asked to design a suit for salvage work on the wreck of the P&O liner SS Egypt which had sunk in 122 m (400 ft) of water off Ushant. He declined, on the grounds that his prototype suit was too heavy for a diver to handle easily, but was encouraged by the request to begin work on a new suit using lighter materials. By 1929 he believed he had solved the weight problem, by using cast magnesium instead of steel, and had also managed to improve the design of the suit's joints by using a trapped cushion of oil to keep the surfaces moving smoothly.The oil, which was virtually non-compressible and readily displaceable, allowed the limb joints to move freely at depths of 600 ft (180 m), where the pressure was 520 psi (35 atm). Peress claimed that the Tritonia suit's joints could function at 1,200 ft (370 m) although this was never proven. In 1930 Peress revealed the Tritonia suit. By May it had completed trials and was publicly demonstrated in a tank at Byfleet. In September Peress' assistant Jim Jarret dived in the suit to a depth of 123 m (404 ft) in Loch Ness. The suit performed perfectly, the joints proving resistant to pressure and moving freely even at depth. The suit was offered to the Royal Navy which turned it down, stating that Navy divers never needed to descend below 90 m (300 ft). Jim Jarret made a deep dive to 305 m (1,001 ft) on the wreck of the RMS Lusitania off south Ireland, followed by a shallower dive to 60 metres (200 ft) in the English Channel in 1937 after which, due to lack of interest, the Tritonia suit was retired. Peress abandoned work on diving suits and instead turned to pioneering work in plastic moulding, later forming a company which became the world's largest manufacturer of gas turbine blades for the aircraft industry. In 1965, Peress came back from retirement, starting his collaboration with two British engineers, Mike Humphrey and Mike Borrow, interested in designing a modern atmospheric diving suit. The first order of business was finding the original Tritonia suit, which turned up in a Glasgow warehouse. After all these years, the old suit was still in working conditions, and the octogenarian Peress became the first person to test it in a factory test tank. In 1969 Peress became a consultant to UMEL (Underwater Marine Equipment Limited), the new company formed by Humphrey and Borrow, which eventually created the JIM suit, which was named after Peress' diver Jim Jarret.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Engineer", "wiki_name": "Joseph_Salim_Peress", "word_count": 618, "label": "Engineer", "people": "Joseph Salim Peress"}

{"text": "Jacob Acker was a painter in the second half of the 15th century in Ulm, Germany. He painted the impressive altar in the St. Leonhard cemetery Chapel in Ehingen (Donau)-Risstissen, Germany which bears his inscription Jacob acker maler zu ulm hat diese dafel gemacht uf des hailligen Kreutz tag an herst. anno dmi MCCCCLXXXIII jar. This means: \\\"Jacob Acker, painter in Ulm has completed this painting on the day of the holy cross in the year of 1483\\\". Not much is known about this Jacob Acker \\\"der J\u00fcngere\\\" (the younger). Most probably he belonged to the extended Ulm artist family of the Acker, many of them members of the so-called \\\"Ulmer Schule\\\" (school of Ulm). This dynasty of artists started with Jakob Acker \\\"dem \u00c4lteren\\\" (the elder), who lived around 1400. He painted some of the glass windows of the Ulm cathedral today still existing. His son Hans Acker (about 1380-1461) continued with this profession and also his glass windows still can be admired in the Ulm cathedral. Whether Jacob Acker \\\"der Juengere\\\" is a son or brother of Hans Acker is not known. But it is known that Jakob Acker d. J. had produced doors with paintings for the main organ of the Ulm cathedral. This organ and Jakob Acker's doors are lost. In 1529 Ulm converted to Protestantism; under the radical influence of the reformer Zwingli on the so-called \u201cG\u00f6tzentag\u201d during summer 1531 the people of Ulm burned most paintings, altars and organs of the Ulm cathedral in a huge fire on the square in front of the cathedral. The Germans called this fundamentalist Protestant religious movement \\\"die Bilderst\u00fcrmer\\\" (iconoclasts). Because Risstissen, some 12 miles southwest of Ulm, then only partially owned by the city of Ulm remained Roman Catholic, Jakob Acker's remarkable Risstissen altar survived. It is believed to have been part of the decoration of the then gothic main church of Risstissen, which was removed at the end of the 18th century, to give way for the actual main church.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Painter", "wiki_name": "Jacob_Acker", "word_count": 334, "label": "Painter", "people": "Jacob Acker"}

He was a scholar of Francesco Torbido, called Il Moro, whose daughter he married, and whose name he added to his own. He improved his style by studying the works of Titian, and painted several pictures, both in oil and fresco, for the churches at Verona, and sometimes in competition with Paolo Veronese. In Sant'Euphemia he had painted a fresco of 'Paul before Ananias,' which, on the demolition of the wall on which it was painted, was sawn out with great care, and removed to another part of the church. His colouring is more vigorous than that of his instructor, and his design more graceful. Such is his picture in San Stefano of 'An Angel presenting the Palms of Martyrdom to the Innocents'. He also painted much in Venice, Mantua, and Murano. We have several slight but spirited etchings by this master, in which the extremities of the figures are drawn in a very masterly style. In conjunction with Battista Vicentino, he engraved a set of fifty landscapes, mostly after Titian, which are executed in a bold, free style. He labored in Mantua under Giovanni Battista Bertani.

In 1987 David opened his own restaurant, \\\"Bouley,\\\" in TriBeCa overlooking Duane Park. Bouley quickly became known as the most notable dining experience in New York and set a new standard for fine dining in America. Among the many accolades earned was a Four-Star review in The New York Times and James Beard Foundation awards for the Best Restaurant and Best Chef among other Beard Awards. Most recently, in 2015, Bouley was awarded the \\\"Best Restaurant Award in the United States\\\" from TripAdvisor's Traveler's Choice Awards, ranking #15 in the world.

{"text": "Keith Edwards (born 16 July 1957) was an English footballer. Edwards actually started his early career as a youth player with Leyton Orient in London, as his father was an Orient supporter. He became homesick and joined Sheffield United. A prolific goalscorer, he had two spells (1975\u20131978 and 1981\u20131986) at Sheffield United for whom he scored 171 goals in 293 appearances. Whilst with the Blades, he was the highest scoring player in a division twice, scoring 36 goals (one for Hull City) in Division 4 in 1981\u201382 and 33 goals in Division 3 in 1983\u201384. The latter haul earned Edwards his second Adidas Golden Boot award. His debut for United came in a FA Cup Third Round Tie against Leicester City on 3 January 1976 and his League debut came on 28 February 1976 in a Division 1 game against Queens Park Rangers. However, his first goal didn't arrive until the next season in Division 2 against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 24 August 1976. In between his time at Bramall Lane he played for Hull City who paid \u00a350,000 for Edwards in 1978. Ian Porterfield bought him back for \u00a3100,000 and played him for the first time against Scunthorpe United on 26 September 1981, the 1\u20130 home victory being the first of a 17-game unbeaten run. Edwards scored his first two goals under Porterfield in a 4\u20130 win over Crewe Alexandra three days later. He formed an impressive partnership with Bob Hatton, feeding off the distribution of Colin Morris as United ended the season with 19 games without defeat to win the Fourth Division Championship, his 35 goals being a post-war record. His final appearance for United came in a pre-season friendly at Bramall Lane against Spanish club Sevilla FC on 1 August 1986. He began the 1986\u201387 season at Leeds United after a transfer fee of \u00a3125,000 but only managed 9 goals in 51 appearances, although one of those was against Coventry City in the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough in 1987. Despite his efforts, Leeds lost the game 3-2. They also missed out on promotion to the First Division weeks later, losing the relegation/promotion playoff final to Charlton Athletic in a replay. Aberdeen secured his services later in 1987 and he returned to Hull City in 1988. He later played for Stockport County, Huddersfield Town and finished his career at Plymouth Argyle in 1990. He is one of the select band of players to have scored over 250 league goals in English football, although almost all of his career was spent outside the top flight.

Marie-Paule Archambault started out as a vendeuse for Raoul-Jean Four\u00e9 who had launched his fashion house in Montreal in about 1927. At the age of 26 she launched a dressmaking business on what would become the De Maisonneuve Boulevard. She received publicity early on through her participation in a charity fashion show at the Windsor Hotel, and after a trip to Paris where she visited several fashion salons, she came back to launch her own fashion salon at 648 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal in 1936. From 1941-1949, she ran a couture workroom, employing about twenty workers, in the department store Holt Renfrew from Montr\u00e9al, where her creations could be purchased from the Salon Marie-Paule. Marie-Paule married Jean Nolin in 1949, and they had two daughters, Patricia and Marie-Claire. From 1949 to 1955 Marie-Paule worked from home, until in 1955 she relocated her business to an office at 1426 Sherbrooke Street, operating as 'Marie-Paule Haute Couture'. The following year she became President of the Association of Canadian Couturiers (ACC), whose purpose was to promote Canadian high fashion design. Along with Four\u00e9 (the ACC's first President), other founding members included Colpron d'Anjou, Marcel Martel, Jacques de Montejoye, and Federica of Toronto. From 1959 to 1965, she was part of the crew of the weekly radio program Femina at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Montreal, informing the audience about design and its philosophical and historical background and development. In 1962, Nolin lost a lot of her work in a house fire, and subsequently relocated to 420 Bonsecours Street. In 1969 she launched a ready-to-wear line, although her refusal to compromise by using cheaper fabrics led to the failure of the venture. Marie-Paule Nolin retired in 1974, and closed her business, which was the last couture establishment in Montreal. In 1984, a major retrospective of her work was presented by the McCord Museum in Montreal.

Listed at 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m), 175 lb., Gray batted and threw right-handed. He was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1984 out of Florida State University. A forkball specialist, Gray started his professional career in 1984 in the Phillies' minor league system, pitching for two years before joining the Cincinnati organization. In 1986, he posted a 14\u20132 record with a 2.35 ERA and 15 saves for Double-A Vermont, and in 1988, he went 8\u20135 with five saves and a 1.97 in 42 appearances for Triple-A Nashville, gaining promotion to the Reds during midseason. He recorded a 3.86 ERA in five games and did not have a decision, returning to Triple-A the next year. Then, he rejoined Philadelphia before the 1990 season. At the end of the 1990 spring training, Gray was told by the Phillies that he had not made the club; they asked him to go to Double-A Reading. Gray rejected the offer and signed with Triple-A Pawtucket, arriving to the Boston Red Sox during the midseason to become a significant contributor to the American League division winners. Gray collected nine saves, but seven of them came in seven chances from August 19 through September 10 as he filled in for injured closer Jeff Reardon. On July 30, 1991, Gray was preparing to go out onto the field for his daily routine. He never made it, as his right side went numb, and he suffered what was diagnosed as a kind of stroke (CVA), ending what had been a brilliant season. One of the best middle relievers of the league at this time, he allowed only 39 hits in 61 \u2154 innings as he had a 2.34 ERA.

He is also co-owner of Beef O'Brady's Restaurant in Sarasota, Florida along with former Red Sox teammate Jody Reed.

A former two-time national champion, he has been awarded the title Grandmaster by the World Chess Federation (FIDE). Born in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, he moved with his family to Germany at the age of five and was subsequently raised in the city of Wiesbaden. It was soon apparent that he had a talent for the game and he became the national junior champion in 1978. Just two years later, his continued rapid progress enabled him to attain International Master status and win the West German Championship at Bad Neuenahr. Buoyed by success, it was not long before he decided to become a full-time chess professional, whereupon he broke from his law degree to embark on the international chess tournament circuit. There were several notable achievements from the outset, including victories at Biel 1981 (with Vlastimil Hort), Ramat Hasharon 1982 and Manila 1982 (with Lev Polugaevsky). His qualification as a Grandmaster occurred the same year and he followed up with several more tournament wins, either outright or shared; at New York Kavkasian 1983 and New York Manhattan 1985 (both invitation tournaments), Biel 1986 (again with Lev Polugaevsky), Brussels and Ter Apel (both 1987), Lyons 1988 (with Simen Agdestein), the strong New York (Open) 1992 as sole winner, Wiesbaden and Graz (both 1993), Bad Zwesten 2000 and Wijk aan Zee 2003.

His name is attached to several large pictures of banquets in Veronese's style. Alessandro Turchi worked briefly under him. As the most talented member of his father's workshop, he undoubtedly executed many works that are attributed to his father. Works that have been clearly isolated as Carlo's own are more precise and delicate, both technically and in the physical types; they lack Veronese's bravura, whether in the line and wash of a chiaroscuro drawing or in the richly layered pigments that make an embroidered drape. His early signed works show the influence of both his father and the Bassano family by whom he was trained. They include Angelica and Medoro (c. 1584; Padua, Barbieri priv. col.), which has a preciousness in the landscape and in details of foliage and coiffures that sets it apart from Veronese's work. The signed Nativity (c. 1588; Brescia, S Afra) combines narrative detail typical of the Bassano with morphological similarities to Veronese.

Staying at Cambridge as a fellow of Emmanuel College he completed his doctorate following work on soil deformation models. It was here that he met and married Elizabeth Gorham with whom he would have three daughters and a son. Hambly left academia to spend five years working with Ove Arup and Partners in the design of structures and Gifford and Partners in bridge building. He devised new models and work methods for the approximation of structural behaviour which he published in 1976 in his first book, Bridge Deck Behaviour. In 1974 he set up his own consultancy and worked from his home in Hertfordshire, writing more than 40 technical papers to supplement his income. One of his first contracts was to investigate the design of bridge foundations for the Building Research Establishment, publishing some of his findings in Bridge Foundations and Substructures in 1979. He was asked by the oil and gas extraction industries to advise upon offshore platforms damaged by wave fatigue and collisions. His expertise in the industry was widely recognized and he was created a fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers in 1982, of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1984 and of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1991.

He earned a high standing in the art world of his time, and his home in Rome was a meeting place for artists such as Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Louise Seidler and Bertel Thorvaldsen.

He contributed immensely toward this end, taking the Nazarenes art to the general public, increasing recognition of the work. As an art collector, von Quandt differed from other collectors in that he always allowed artists to choose their own subjects.

His use of a revolutionary combination bat, with different rubbers on either side, completely bamboozled his opponents, coupled with his defensive play, and led to one of sport's greatest upsets. Ultimately, the table tennis authorities had to change the rules because of Hilton, so that either side of a bat had different coloured rubbers. This gave the opposing player the chance to spot which rubber his opponent was using. Hilton used a bat which had black rubber (one side antiloop the other side very spinny) on both sides, meaning that opponents generally had no clue which rubber he was using when he 'twiddled' his bat in mid-rally, especially when his sleight of hand was coupled with him squeaking the soles of his shoes on the floor at the moment of bat on ball impact, this additional tactic masking the slight difference in sound between anti-loop surface and spinny surface. Hilton still plays table tennis in the Bolton league which his team famously won in the 2012-13 season.

According to the contemporary Giovanni Camillo Sagrestani, Ferretti was a pupil of the Bolognese painter Giuseppe Maria Crespi. Others say he worked with painter Giovanni Gioseffo dal Sole. He returned to Florence with a letter of recommendation of Cardinal Gozzadini seeking patronage from Cosimo III de' Medici. He found work in the studio of Tommaso Redi and Sebastiano Galeotti. He travelled to Bologna to work under Felice Torelli and then resettled in Florence in 1715. Ferretti soon joined the Florentine Accademia del Disegno, where he later taught painting but also designed tapestries for the Medici. He found abundant patronage in fresco painting for the Florentine Abbey (Badia Fiorentina), the Chapel of San Giuseppe in the Duomo, and the altar and cupola of the Church of San Salvatore al Vescovo. One of his most important works was the decoration of the ceiling of the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine, since lost in a fire. Ferretti's fresco style was influenced by Sebastiano Ricci's lively, colourful, and pastel-hued frescoes in the Palazzo Marucelli-Fenzi.

In 1889 he invented the goal net for use in football matches and he said that this was the invention of which he was the most proud. Brodie returned to Liverpool in 1898 as the city engineer suggesting several improvements for the town such as the UK's first ring road, electric trams and the East Lancashire Road, the UK's first intercity highway. He was at the fore front of pre-fabricated housing technology promoting the use of pre-cast reinforced concrete slabs as a means of building houses quickly and cheaply, he presented an example of this technique to the Cheap Cottages Exhibition at Letchworth where many examples of this kind of building can be found to this day. The design attracted attention from across the world and he is known to have influenced Grosvenor Atterbury who used a similar technique to build the houses at Forest Hills Gardens. Brodie was also interested in town planning and this was recognised in 1912 when he was asked to help select the site of and plan New Delhi. He visited India twice for this purpose and in 1931 was invited to the official opening ceremony by the Viceroy owing to the high regard that Edwin Lutyens, the chief planner had for him.

{"text": "William \\\"Bill\\\" Barton Bridgeman (1916 \u2013 September 29, 1968) was an American test pilot who broke aviation records while working for the Douglas Aircraft Company, testing experimental aircraft. In July 1951, the United States Navy announced the D-558-II Skyrocket piloted by Bridgeman had \\\"attained the highest speed and altitude ever recorded by a piloted plane.\\\" On August 15 of the same year, he set a world record with a speed of Mach 1.88 and an unofficial record height of 79,494 feet (24,230 m). Bridgeman was born in Iowa. His father was a barnstormer and separated from his mother shortly after he was born. He was raised in Malibu, California by his paternal grandmother. He enlisted in the United States Navy to attend flight school at Pensacola. He graduated and was commissioned in 1941, and was sent to Pearl Harbor, where he experienced the Japanese attack on December 7. He flew PBY flying boats in the New Guinea/Australia sector, then four-engined PB4Y-2 Privateer patrol bombers on a tour of operations with VP/VPB-109 (the \\\"Reluctant Raiders\\\"). He was reassigned afterwards to training activities stateside from August 1944 until the end of the war, then spent two years flying transport missions from Pearl Harbor to the West Coast. Upon leaving the Navy in 1947, Bridgeman joined Southwest Airlines (a local West Coast airline that eventually merged into Pacific Southwest Airlines, not to be confused with today's Southwest) to fly DC-3s on the San Francisco-Seattle route. Bored with the airline routine, he left in 1949 to join Douglas as a production test pilot to certify A-1 Skyraiders off the assembly line before their delivery to the Navy. A few months later, he was offered and accepted to take over the test program of the D-558 II Skyrocket, one of the world's first supersonic research aircraft. Bridgeman converted to jet aircraft on the F-80 in early 1950 and eventually conducted a very successful test program with the Skyrocket, collecting data on the behavior of swept-wing aircraft over a wide envelope of load factors and Mach numbers deep in the supersonic range. In May 1951, he broke the world speed record with Mach 1.72, then raised the record to Mach 1.88 (1,245 mph, 1,992 km/h) the next month. Immediately afterwards, he broke the world altitude record with 79,494 ft (24,230 m) on the Skyrocket's final flight before delivery to NACA. During this campaign, Bridgeman was one of the first pilots to encounter the phenomenon of inertia coupling, a flight hazard that would dominate high-speed aircraft research for much of the 1950s. He was on the cover of the April 27, 1953 issue of Time magazine. He went on to fly other Douglas test programs including the X-3 Stiletto, a promising but ultimately unsuccessful design. In 1955, he recounted his experiences test-flying the Skyraider and Skyrocket in a successful memoir, The Lonely Sky, written with Jacqueline Hazard, whom he married shortly after the book was published. He was an astronaut candidate for the United States Air Force Man In Space Soonest program, but the program was cancelled on August 1, 1958, and replaced by NASA's Project Mercury. Bridgeman eventually moved to Grumman Aircraft where he conducted test programs of commercial aircraft, then pursued a career in commercial real estate. In September 1968, he was the pilot of a routine air-taxi flight from Los Angeles to Santa Catalina Island when his Grumman Goose amphibian went down in the Pacific Ocean.

{"text": "Robert Orben (born March 4, 1927) is best known as an American professional comedy writer, though he also worked as a speechwriter for Gerald R. Ford and as a magician. He has written multiple books on comedy, mostly collections of gags and \\\"one-liners\\\" originally written for his newsletter, Orben's Current Comedy, and he has also written books for magicians. Robert Orben published his first gag book at the age of 18 in 1946, when he was working in Stuart Robson Jr.'s (stage manager for Florenz Ziegfeld) conjuror's shop in New York. Professional magicians would use his gags to add humor to their acts; comedians also came into magic stores, for props and books, as there were no comedy stores or resources as such at that time. When Robert Orben wrote his first gag book, Encyclopedia of Patter, it proved very popular, and he started publishing more books of gags, complete with sketches, ad libs, bits of business and routines. Titles included Patter Parade, Laugh Package, Sight Bits, and Screamline Comedy. By the 1950s, Orben gag books were ubiquitous in the comedy profession and were probably overused by stand-up comedians. Orben has said he nearly sued Lenny Bruce once, as Bruce advertised his show with the tag line, \\\"No Joe Miller, no corn, no Orben\\\". However, Orben never sued, and only saw Bruce perform once, shortly before Bruce's death. In addition to his gag and humor books, he started publishing a regular newsletter of topical humor, Orben's Current Comedy, which he wrote for nearly 30 years, stopping in 1989. Other comedy writers, including Gary Apple and Daniel R. White, attempted to keep the newsletter going, under the name Current Comedy, but none were able to halt the decline of subscriptions, and eventually the rights to it were sold. As Orben's books began to attract attention, he started writing custom-made gags for comedian Dick Gregory for six years. Gregory had contacted him in 1955, when Gregory was starting out in Chicago. Orben told him to get in touch when he'd found his own comedic voice. In 1962, Gregory telegrammed Orben, saying there would be a two-page article in Time about him. Orben bought the magazine and saw the article, and shortly after, the two signed a contract to work together. Orben also wrote for Jack Paar on The Tonight Show in New York City (1962\u201363), and the Red Skelton Show in Hollywood (1964\u201370). Later, Orben moved into politics, and in 1973 he became head speechwriter to Vice President Gerald R. Ford. When Ford succeeded to the Presidency in August, 1974, Orben became his speechwriter. In January 1976 he was appointed Special Assistant to President Ford and Director of the White House Speechwriting Department. As of 2007, Orben works as a speaker for corporate events.

According to Walter Gilbey, Brown was a house and sign painter who \\\"cherished higher artistic ambitions and had set his heart on learning to painting like George Morland,\\\" a British artist famous for his animal paintings and scenes of rustic life. After selling his business, Brown studied with Morland and became one of his many imitators. Although his paintings featured a more gestural brushstroke and a heavier use of impasto, his works often passed for those of his master. Brown exhibited ten paintings at the Royal Academy between 1792 and 1797, including pasticci of Morland and views of London, which some critics have suggested are his most successful works. He supplemented his income during these years by selling paintings by Morland that he had acquired during his tenure in the artist's studio.

This airbrushing led to speculation about \\\"lost cosmonauts\\\" even though the actual reasons were often mundane. Alexei Leonov recounts that years later, while Anikeyev was at a party one night, someone stole his keys from his pocket and stole his car. The thief hit and killed a pedestrian, and to avoid responsibility, returned the keys to Anikeyev's pocket.

The moniker was coined by Bob Hunt, an NBL announcer at the 1982 NBL Grand Nationals that Tommy raced in. Many racers received their monikers from the pithy play by play race announcers. Tommy Brackens was a former motorcycle motocross (MX) racer that made the switch to BMX in 1977 (he would return to MX after his BMX career). Quiet, shy and highly likable he was believed to have all the talents to be truly a top level racer. If Mr. Brackens was likable he had a strong desire to be liked. One of his goals was to be voted as the fan favorite among kids as their favorite racer; \\\"...to be the people's favorite is my goal.\\\" he said. That goal was fulfilled in 1987 When he won BMX Action's Number One Racer Award (NORA) Cup for that year. Unfortunately his inconsistency prevented him from winning a national number one plate for any association amateur or professional. The closest was a National No. 2 with the NBL in 1986. He failed to transfer out of his semi (crashed) while only a few points behind the eventual No.1 for that year, Pete Loncarevich (who was not doing well himself at the time and barely qualified for the main).

Schalk was involved in the preparation of several of Bruckner's scores for their first publication or performance: these include the Third and Eighth symphonies, along with the Mass in F Minor.

The term \\\"HMO\\\" was coined by Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, Jr., in a January 1970 Fortune Magazine article. More recently, he has advanced an agenda for monitoring health outcomes, so that patients, providers, and payers can make health care decisions based on real information about what treatments and providers are actually effective. Ellwood began his career as a pediatric neurologist, specializing in polio at the height of the international polio epidemic in the early 1950s. The epidemic subsided with the introduction of the polio vaccine by Jonas Salk. The Sister Kenny Institute, which Ellwood directed, then filled its vacant beds with children suffering from learning disabilities. According to Ellwood, one evening while doing rounds amid crying children, it struck him that they were making decisions for economic reasons (the need to fill hospital beds) that were not in the best interests of patients. His growing conviction that this calculus \u2013 putting the interests of health care providers over patient well-being \u2013 characterized the American medical system in general, led him to conceive of and advocate for alternative approaches.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Scientist", "l3": "Medician", "wiki_name": "Paul_M._Ellwood,_Jr.", "word_count": 241, "label": "Medician", "people": "Paul M.

His father was a schoolmaster who also wrote poetry. From 1910\u20131914, R\u00e4derscheidt studied at the Academy of D\u00fcsseldorf. He was severely wounded in the First World War, during which he fought at Verdun. After the war he returned to Cologne, where in 1919 he cofounded the artists' group Stupid with other members of the local constructivist and dada scene. The group was short-lived, as R\u00e4derscheidt was by 1920 abandoning constructivism for a magic realist style. In 1925, he participated in the Neue Sachlichkeit (\\\"New Objectivity\\\") exhibition at the Mannheim Kunsthalle. Many of the works R\u00e4derscheidt produced in the 1920s depict a stiffly posed, isolated couple that usually bear the features of R\u00e4derscheidt and his wife, the painter Martha Hegemann. The influence of metaphysical art is apparent in the way the mannequin-like figures stand detached from their environment and from each other. A pervasive theme is the incompatibility of the sexes, according to the art historian Dennis Crockett. Few of R\u00e4derscheidt's works from this era survive, because most of them were either seized by the Nazis as degenerate art and destroyed, or were destroyed in Allied bombing raids. His marriage to Marta ended in 1933. In 1934\u20131935 he lived in Berlin. He fled to France in 1936, and settled in Paris, where his work became more colorful, curvilinear and rhythmic. He was interned by the occupation authorities in 1940, but he escaped to Switzerland. In 1949 he returned to Cologne and resumed his work, producing many paintings of horses shortly before adopting an abstract style in 1957.

He painted for the church of San Girolamo della Carit\u00e0, one of the chapels in fresco and an altar-piece in oil, representing the Virgin and child with Saints Bartolomeo and Alessandro. For Santa Maria de' Monti, he painted an Annunciation. He also painted the famous 'Martyr's Painting' in the Main Chapel of the Venerable English College in Rome. The painting represents the Blessed Trinity and St Thomas to whom the church was dedicated.

{"text": "Isambard Kingdom Brunel FRS (9 April 1806 \u2013 15 September 1859), was an English mechanical and civil engineer who is considered \\\"one of the most ingenious and prolific figures in engineering history\\\", \\\"one of the 19th century engineering giants\\\", and \\\"one of the greatest figures of the Industrial Revolution, [who] changed the face of the English landscape with his groundbreaking designs and ingenious constructions\\\". Brunel built dockyards, the Great Western Railway, a series of steamships including the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship and numerous important bridges and tunnels. His designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering. Though Brunel's projects were not always successful, they often contained innovative solutions to long-standing engineering problems. During his career, Brunel achieved many engineering \\\"firsts\\\", including assisting in the building of the first tunnel under a navigable river and development of SS Great Britain, the first propeller-driven ocean-going iron ship, which was at the time (1843) also the largest ship ever built. Brunel set the standard for a well-built railway, using careful surveys to minimise grades and curves. This necessitated expensive construction techniques and new bridges and viaducts, and the two-mile-long Box Tunnel. One controversial feature was the wide gauge, a \\\"broad gauge\\\" of 7 ft 1\u20444 in (2,140 mm), instead of what was later to be known as 'standard gauge' of 4 ft 8 1\u20442 in (1,435 mm). Brunel astonished Britain by proposing to extend the Great Western Railway westward to North America by building steam-powered iron-hulled ships. He designed and built three ships that revolutionised naval engineering. In 2002, Brunel was placed second in a BBC public poll to determine the \\\"100 Greatest Britons\\\". In 2006, the bicentenary of his birth, a major programme of events celebrated his life and work under the name Brunel 200.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Engineer", "wiki_name": "Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel", "word_count": 294, "label": "Engineer", "people": "Isambard Kingdom Brunel"}

Millar started his career at restaurants in Corfu, Zurich and London before returning to Northern Ireland to work in Paul Rankin's Roscoff restaurant in Belfast. While at Roscoff he met his future wife Shirley, who managed the restaurant. In 1994 he opened Shanks Restaurant at the Blackwood golf centre, part of the Clandeboye Estate in Bangor. In 1996 the restaurant was awarded a Michelin Star, an award it held for ten years. Other awards include the Egon Ronay Guide Newcomer of the Year in 1995 and three Automobile Association rosettes. Millar was columnist for the Belfast Telegraph and made regular television appearances as a judge on the BBC's MasterChef programme with Lloyd Grossman. Influenced by Rankin, Shanks had a Californian style. The interior of the restaurant was designed by Terence Conran. In August 2005 Millar was killed in a car accident on the Ballysallagh Road near Holywood, County Down. His Maserati left the road, hitting a fence and killing him instantly. The road is an accident blackspot, with two other deaths in April 2006. His funeral was attended by other prominent local chefs Paul & Jeanne Rankin and Michael Deane. On 31 May 2006 the coroner's report into Millar's death was released. It found that he died of multiple injuries, mainly caused by the fence he crashed into. A road accident expert stated that if the fence had met new safety standards, Millar might have survived the crash. While his blood alcohol level was found to be marginally over the legal limit, the coroner did not find this to be a significant cause. Millar is interred in Ballycarry New Cemetery, alongside his brother Brian, who died in 1982.

When the South African Medical and Dental Council (SAMDC) declined to discipline the chief district surgeon and his assistant who treated Biko, Ames and a group of five academics and physicians raised funds and fought an eight-year legal battle against the medical establishment. Ames risked her personal safety and academic career in her pursuit of justice, taking the dispute to the South African Supreme Court, where she eventually won the case in 1985. Born in Pretoria and raised in poverty in Cape Town, Ames became the first woman to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Cape Town in 1964. Ames studied the effects of cannabis on the brain and published several articles on the subject; seeing the therapeutic benefits of cannabis on patients in her own hospital, she became an early proponent of legalization for medicinal use. She headed the neurology department at Groote Schuur Hospital before retiring in 1985, but continued to lecture at Valkenberg and Alexandra Hospital. After apartheid was finally dismantled in 1994, Ames testified at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission about her work on the \\\"Biko doctors\\\" medical ethics inquiry.

Rieber later recalled: \\\"Detroit really moved players around a lot.\\\" In August 1942, the Tigers called Riebe up to the big leagues. He played his first major league game in Philadelphia on August 26, 1942, in the second game of a Sunday double-header. Riebe hit a two-run double down the left field line. He went 2-for-4 in his major league debut and 4-for-4 a week later in his first game at Briggs Stadium. In all, Riebe hit .314 in 11 games for the Tigers in 1942. After a promising start to his baseball career, Riebe was drafted into the U.S. Army after the 1942 season ended. He served in the 66th Infantry Division in Europe. On Christmas Eve 1944, Riebe was aboard the SS Leopoldville headed for Cherbourg, France, when it was sunk by torpedoes fired by a German U-boat. Riebe floated in the icy water of the English Channel and a Coast Guard cutter pulled him out. Over 750 American troops lost their lives in the sinking of the Leopoldville. Riebe was awarded a Purple Heart medal for injuries suffered in the Leopoldville sinking and later served with the 66th Infantry as it moved across Europe. In the spring of 1945, Riebe was injured by shrapnel from German artillery, earning his second Purple Heart award. Riebe recalled listening on the radio from a tent in France as his teammates on the Detroit Tigers won the 1945 World Series.

Smith went on to score thirty goals in seventy-five starts, including seventeen during the 2002\u201303 season as the Terriers were relegated. He signed for Northampton Town from Huddersfield Town on 1 July 2003 after being chased for a few months by their then manager Martin Wilkinson. Smith started as a forward; however in recent seasons he has been used as a midfielder, continuing to regularly find the net for Northampton during their promotion from League Two during the 2005\u201306 season. At the end of that season the then Northampton Town manager Colin Calderwood left for Nottingham Forest. Smith enjoyed a good relationship with Calderwood and although new Northampton Town manager John Gorman worked hard to try to keep Smith at the Sixfields Stadium, Darlington (managed at the time by David Hodgson) eventually got their man.

Dr. Sacco's space mission was flying asa payload specialist on STS-73, which launched on October 20, 1995. It landed at the Kennedy Space Center on November 5, 1995. The mission took place over a span of 16 days. It focused on materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, and fluid physics contained within the pressurized Spacelab module. Albert Sacco has divided his time between teaching and research. Although most known for his scientific contributions, Sacco is also a huge family man. He ran a family restaurant with his father and brother for over 20 years in Boston. Currently, Albert Sacco's research is investigating the production of quantum wires using titanosilicates. He is also investigating using bacteria and yeast for trace gas detection by mixing these living systems with high performing semiconductors.His hypothesis is that these systems will self repair while carrying out a task. The technique used for his is called multifunctional materials, which are materials that can start on contact with an electrical circuit. This in turn will produce radicals to destroy harmful contaminates. This will be used in close food production and close loop live support systems on submarines and spacecrafts. On top of that, Dr. Sacco is in the process of developing a new method of photo catalysis that will help kill harmful bacteria and fungus in the production of food. Albert Sacco is also involved in the production of compound membranes for use in fuel cells for cars. Albert Sacco is held in high esteem by many.

An excellent outside shooter for a 7 footer, he was on the United States Olympic basketball team that won the gold at the 1964 Summer Olympics. He played in college for Oregon State University and was selected by the Boston Celtics in the 1964 NBA draft. The Celtics won the NBA Championship in 1965 and 1966 with Counts on the team as Bill Russell's backup, but he was traded for the 1967 season to the Baltimore Bullets. Halfway through that season he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, who made it to the playoffs that year. The next three seasons Counts' Lakers made it to the NBA Finals, where they would play in and ultimately lose three years in a row. In the 1969 NBA Finals, Counts indirectly played a role in one of the most controversial coaching decisions in NBA history. In game 7, starting Laker center Wilt Chamberlain, who had never fouled out of a game, picked up his 5th foul with 6 minutes to play. A minute later, Wilt came off the floor limping and was replaced by Counts with the Lakers trailing the Celtics by nine points. The Lakers cut the deficit to one point on a shot by Counts, with coach Butch van Breda Kolff refusing to reinsert Chamberlain into the game in the final minutes even though Wilt said his knee felt good enough to play. The Lakers lost the game, 108-106, and the series, 4-3. (As it turned out, Chamberlain severely injured the same knee early the next season and missed 70 games. The fiery van Breda Kolff was fired). Counts played one more season with the Lakers before being traded to the Phoenix Suns with the Lakers gaining the return of hall of famer Gail Goodrich (he started with the Lakers but went to Phoenix in the 1967 expansion draft).

He played most of his career for Serie A club Internazionale, from 1995 to 2014, and served as their captain from 1999, earning him the nickname \\\"Il Capitano\\\" (The Captain). Known for his versatility, he was adept on both the left and right wing, having played on both flanks as a full-back, as well as a winger. He could also play as a defensive midfielder. On retiring, the club retired his number 4 jersey and named him as Vice President. Known as \\\"Pupi\\\" in Argentina, Zanetti was born in Buenos Aires, picking up the nickname \\\"El Tractor\\\" (The Tractor) soon after his move to Italy where his strength, resilience, stamina, and his ability to run past opposing defenders when joining the attack from his right back position earned him reverence. Zanetti won several honours with Inter, including five Serie A and four Coppa Italia titles. The 2010 UEFA Champions League Final on 22 May 2010 was Zanetti's 700th game with Inter, and the team's victory on the night made him the only captain to win a treble with an Italian club. Internationally, he holds the record of the most capped player in the history of the Argentine national team. He won a silver medal at the 1996 Olympic tournament, and played in five Copa Am\u00e9rica tournaments, two FIFA Confederations Cups, and two World Cups (1998 and 2002), winning runners-up medals at the 2004 and 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica tournaments, and in the 1995 and 2005 Confederations Cups. He holds the record for the highest all-time appearances by a non-Italian born player for an Italian club and his 858 official matches for the club put him first in Inter's all-time appearances list. He holds the most competitive appearances for an outfield-player in football history, with 1123 matches played. Only Rog\u00e9rio Ceni (1257) and Peter Shilton (1362) have played more matches.

{"text": "Michael Schumacher (born 3 January 1969) is a German retired racing driver. He is a seven-time Formula One World Champion and is widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time. He was named Laureus World Sportsman of the Year twice. He won two titles with Benetton in 1994 and 1995 before moving to Ferrari where he drove for eleven years. His time with Ferrari yielded five consecutive titles between 2000 and 2004. Schumacher holds many of Formula One's driver records, including most championships, race victories, fastest laps, pole positions and most races won in a single season \u2013 13 in 2004 (the last of these records was equalled by fellow German Sebastian Vettel nine years later). In 2002, he became the only driver in Formula One history to finish in the top three in every race of a season and then also broke the record for most consecutive podium finishes. According to the official Formula One website, he is \\\"statistically the greatest driver the sport has ever seen\\\". After beginning in karting, Schumacher won the German drivers' championships in Formula K\u00f6nig and Formula Three before joining Mercedes in the World Sportscar Championship. In 1991, his Mercedes-funded race debut for the Jordan Formula One team resulted in Schumacher being signed by Benetton Formula One team as their driver for the rest of that season. Establishing himself as a top driver, finishing third in 1992 and fourth in 1993, Schumacher became the first German World Drivers' Champion in 1994 by one point over Damon Hill. In 1995 he repeated the success, this time with a greater margin. Schumacher moved to Ferrari in 1996. Schumacher came close to winning the 1997 and 1998 titles, before breaking his leg at the 1999 British Grand Prix, ending another title run. Things then came good for Schumacher who won another five consecutive drivers' titles from 2000 to 2004. Schumacher retired from Formula One driving in 2006 staying with Ferrari as an advisor. He came close to an eighth title that year, but due to technical problems in the final two races he fell short to Fernando Alonso. Schumacher agreed to return for Ferrari part-way through 2009, as cover for the badly injured Felipe Massa, but was prevented by a neck injury. Schumacher returned to Formula One on a permanent basis from 2010 with the Mercedes team before retiring for a second time at the conclusion of the 2012 season. His career was not without controversy, including being twice involved in collisions in the final race of a season that determined the outcome of the World Championship, with Damon Hill in 1994 in Adelaide, and with Jacques Villeneuve in 1997 in Jerez. Off the track, Schumacher is an ambassador for UNESCO and a spokesman for driver safety. He has been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts throughout his life and donated tens of millions of dollars to charity. Schumacher and his younger brother, Ralf, are the only brothers to win races in Formula One, and they were the first brothers to finish 1st and 2nd in the same race, a feat they repeated in four subsequent races. In December 2013, Schumacher suffered a serious head injury while skiing. He was airlifted to a hospital and placed in a medically induced coma, having suffered a traumatic brain injury. He was in the coma for six months from 29 December 2013 until 16 June 2014. He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the University Hospital (CHUV) in Lausanne.

In the same year, he was recommissioned in a Regiment of Invalids and, according to Hooper and Whyld, \\\"In all probability he died soon afterwards.\\\" The Noble Game of Chess was sold only at Slaughter's Coffee House. It contained opening analysis and useful advice about the middlegame, and laid down 19 rules for chess play. Most of them are still useful today. Some examples: \\\"2.

His first assignment to Moscow was in 1961, and it was from the embassy there that he experienced the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, helping to translate diplomatic messages between the leaders. The next year he was posted to West Africa, and he later served in East Africa, during the post-colonial period of superpower rivalry. At the beginning of d\u00e9tente, he was Director of Soviet Affairs in the State Department, and began to participate in the summit meetings between the leaders, eventually attending all but one of the U.S. \u2013 Soviet summits held in the 20-year period 1972\u201391. Matlock was back in Moscow in 1974, serving in the number two position in the embassy for four years. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in early 1980 ended the period of reduced tensions. Matlock was assigned to Moscow again in 1981 as acting ambassador during the first part of Ronald Reagan's presidency. Reagan appointed him as ambassador to Czechoslovakia and later asked him to return to Washington in 1983 to work at the National Security Council, with the assignment to develop a negotiating strategy to end the arms race. When Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, arms negotiations and summit meetings resumed. Matlock was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1987 and saw the last years of the Soviet Union before he retired from the Foreign Service in 1991. After leaving the Foreign Service, he wrote an account of the end of the Soviet Union titled Autopsy on an Empire, followed by an account of the end of the Cold War titled Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended, establishing his reputation as a historian. He joined the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study and he went on to teach diplomacy at several New England colleges.

He competed in five Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 3 September 1950. Although, on his day, his experience with the cars meant that he was often one of the fastest men on the racetrack, somehow this rarely translated into good results. He scored only 3 championship points. He found some success driving in sports car racing, continuing into the mid-1960s. On the 1953 Mille Miglia he posted the fastest stage average speed, 112.8 mph (181.5 km/h), beating greats such as Nino Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio, but on this occasion his car let him down and he failed to finish. A year later he won his class in the Carrera Panamericana. Sanesi entered an Alfa Romeo in the November 1954 Pan American race in Mexico. In the European touring car class of the event he led at one juncture with a total time of 8 hours,29 minutes, and 24 seconds. He was overtaken by fellow Italian and Alfa Romeo drivers, Sergio Mantovani and Mario Della Favera. A couple of days later Sanesiestablished a 17-minute lead in his car, with the Alfa Romeo marque sweeping the first fivepositions of the European touring car division. He gave up front line racing following a near-death accident during the 1964 12 Hours of Sebring race, when following a crash his Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ burst into flames. Only the prompt and courageous actions of Jocko Maggiocommo, a fellow driver watching at the trackside who dived into the flames and pulled Sanesi clear, saved his life. Sanesi was paired with driver Roberto Bussinello in the event. Maggiacomo received a Gentleman of the Road award in November 1964 for his effort in rescuing Sanesi.

Raised around horses from infancy, he learned how to train them from his father while working with him at Woolford Farm in Prairie Village, Kansas from 1931 to 1939, after which his father signed on as the head trainer at Calumet Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. There, Jimmy worked as his father's assistant but his career was interrupted when he joined the United States military during World War II. After the war ended he returned to training horses, and in 1948 took over as head trainer from his father, who was appointed Calumet Farm's general manager. In 1948 Jimmy Jones stepped aside as the trainer of record for Citation to allow his father to be officially designated as the trainer for the Kentucky Derby. Ben Jones wanted the opportunity to equal the record of Herbert J. \\\"Derby Dick\\\" Thompson, who had trained four Derby winners. Citation won the race. Ben Jones later returned to training and won the Derby two more times. Jimmy Jones was named Citation's trainer for the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes. Citation became the Jones family's second U.S. Triple Crown winner. In 1957, Jimmy Jones won his first \\\"official\\\" Kentucky Derby with Iron Liege, and claimed victory again the next year with future Hall of Fame colt Tim Tam, who also won the Preakness. Many fans and race experts believe Tim Tam would have won the Triple Crown had he not broken a sesamoid bone in his right foreleg coming down the home stretch in the Belmont Stakes, where he finished second. As head trainer for Calumet Farm, Jimmy Jones trained seven champion horses and won 54 stakes races. In addition to his two Derby wins, he won four Preakness Stakes and one Belmont Stakes. He was the leading trainer in the United States five times (1947, 1948, 1949, 1957, 1961) and was the first trainer to earn more than $1 million in purses in a single season.

{"text": "Arthur Woolf (1766, Camborne, Cornwall \u2013 16 October 1837, Guernsey) was a Cornish engineer, most famous for inventing a high-pressure compound steam engine. As such he made an outstanding contribution to the development and perfection of the Cornish engine. Woolf left Cornwall in 1785 to work for Joseph Bramah's engineering works in London. He worked there and at other firms as an engineer and engine builder until 1811, when he returned to Cornwall. Michael Loam, inventor of the man engine, was trained by him. When he returned to Cornwall, beam engine designs were crude, shackled by outdated Watt patents and poor engineering. He learned from Bramah that to move forward meant adopting much improved engineering techniques, for it was Bramah who invented quality control. Woolf was chief engineer to Harvey & Co of Hayle, a leading engineering and foundry works. They eventually swallowed up the rival Copperhouse Foundry run by Sandys, Carne and Vivian. For very many years they were a leading firm worldwide for drainage engines, even supplying 6 eight-beamed pumping engines to the Dutch government to drain the Haarlemmermeer (see Museum De Cruquius). By the time Woolf retired in 1836 the Cornish engine, largely due to his efforts, was a thing of magnificent beauty and efficiency. In 1803, Woolf obtained a patent on an improved boiler for producing high pressure steam. In 1804, he patented his best-known invention, a compound steam engine.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Engineer", "wiki_name": "Arthur_Woolf", "word_count": 234, "label": "Engineer", "people": "Arthur Woolf"}

Antoni Gaud\u00ed i Cornet (25 June 1852 \u2013 10 June 1926) was a Spanish Catalan architect from Reus and the best known practitioner of Catalan Modernism. Gaud\u00ed's works reflect an individualized and distinctive style. Most are located in Barcelona, including his magnum opus, the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. Gaud\u00ed's work was influenced by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. Gaud\u00ed considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as trencad\u00eds which used waste ceramic pieces. Under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, Gaud\u00ed became part of the Modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream Modernisme, culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms. Gaud\u00ed rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and molding the details as he conceived them. Gaud\u00ed's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by architects. His masterpiece, the still-incomplete Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, is the most-visited monument in Spain. Between 1984 and 2005, seven of his works were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Gaud\u00ed's Roman Catholic faith intensified during his life and religious images appear in many of his works.

After the Russian Revolution, he continued his education and was hired to work as a technician in the aerodynamics laboratory at Moscow State Technical University under the guidance of Nikolai Zhukovsky, while resuming his studies. He gained experience as a laboratory assistant on wind tunnels and calculations for aircraft design. In 1922, he graduated from the same university. In 1921\u20131936, Petlyakov worked at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute under the guidance of Andrei Tupolev, where he was involved in wing design and the development of gliders. In 1936, he became a chief aircraft designer at an aviation plant. Petlyakov was directly involved in organization and development of Soviet metal aircraft construction. In particular, Petlyakov (together with an engineer Nikolai Belyaev) elaborated methods of calculating durability of materials and theory on designing metal wings with multiple spars. Petlyakov assisted in designing the first Soviet heavy bombers TB-1, TB-3 (1930\u20131935), and a long-range high-altitude four-engine bomber, the Pe-8 (1935\u20131937). However, on October 21, 1937, Petlyakov was arrested together with Tupolev and the entire directorate of the TsAGI on trumped up charges of sabotage, espionage and of aiding the Russian Fascist Party. Many of his colleagues were executed. In 1939, he was moved from a prison to an NKVD sharashka for aircraft designers near Moscow, where many ex-TsAGI people had already been sent to work. Petlyakov was tasked with designing a high-altitude fighter, which he successfully accomplished. However, operational experience in the Soviet-Finnish War showed that this was not what the Soviet Air Force needed, and Lavrentiy Beria, head of the NKVD and of the sharashka told that the fighter was to be redesigned as a dive bomber, with the promise that he and his colleagues would be released on its successful completion. The resulting aircraft, the Pe-2, which went into serial production at the Kazan Aviation Plant, proved to be one of the most successful designs of World War II. Petlyakov was released in 1940, and was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1941. However, at Kazan, Petlyakov faced increasing difficulties, with so many of his trained technicians and machinists conscripted into the Soviet military and sent to the front lines, which adversely affected the quality of production aircraft. He protested to Soviet senior leadership, and was on his way to Moscow in January 1942 (flying in a Pe-2), when he died in an air crash near Arzamas. His grave is at the Arskoe Cemetery in Kazan.

Britain's best-known expert on gender reassignment, he was a member of the parliamentary forum on transsexualism. In 2006-2007, Reid was investigated by the General Medical Council (GMC), the regulatory body for doctors in the UK. A serious professional misconduct hearing opened following complaints brought by four doctors from the main NHS Gender Identity Clinic at Charing Cross hospital, west London, and some of his former patients. It is alleged that he breached international standards of care, set by the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA) by inappropriately prescribing cross-gender hormones to patients and referring them for sex reassignment surgery without adequate assessment. Britain's primary lobbying organization for transgender and transsexual people, Press for Change, was quoted as saying that Reid received support during the process from more than 150 patients as well as additional experts in the area. Furthermore, as many as 462 of Dr. Reid' s ex patients posted positive comments during and after his hearing on a blogspot In Support of Dr. Russell Reid, and still continue to leave positive feedback. Ultimately, the enquiry found Reid guilty of Serious Professional Misconduct, mostly for failing to communicate fully with patients GPs (A rule that it is reported many private doctors in the UK are unaware of) and not documenting his reasons for departing from the HBIGDA Standards of Care guidelines sufficiently. However, the panel \\\"determined that it would be in the public interest as well as your own interests if you were to return to practice under strict conditions.\\\" and allowed him to return to practice, subject to some restrictions on his practice and hormone prescriptions for the next 12 months. Reid was a member of an expert committee set up by the Royal College of Psychiatrists to draw up new UK care guidelines on the treatment of Gender identity disorder.

{"text": "Chu Guiting (26 July 1892 \u2013 16 February 1977) was a prolific martial artist who studied under the famous local masters, Jiang Yuhe, Yu Bingzhong, and Chen Delu, and went on to influence many different Chinese martial arts schools through his teaching. In 1912, Chu Guiting began to study Xingyiquan (Shape and Mind Boxing) and Baguazhang (Eight Trigram Boxing) under Grandmaster Li Cunyi, who recognized him as his official disciple. At the age of twenty, Chu Guiting left his hometown and traveled extensively throughout China, visiting Beijing and Tianjin, Liaoning in the north, and Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanchang in the south. In 1921, Chu Guiting studied Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist) in Hangzhou under Yang Chengfu \u2013 a direct descendent of the style's progenitor, Yang Lu-ch'an. In doing so, he became one of the \\\"Five Tiger Generals\\\". Between 1916 and 1940, Chu Guiting was heavily involved in martial arts in both Jiangsu and Shanghai. During this time he worked with the East China Five Province General's Bodyguards, the Central Chinese Boxing Association, the Zhejiang Province Chinese Boxing Association, the Central Police Officers Association, the Presidential Palace Bodyguards, the National Government's Military Department, and the Jiangsu Public Security Headquarters. He also taught Chinese martial arts privately. In 1928, General Li, General Zhang Zi Jiang, and General Fung Zu Ziang held the first full-contact national competition in Nanjing, China. The purpose was to find the best candidates for teaching positions at the government-sponsored Central Martial Arts Academy. Hundreds of the best Chinese martial artists participated in sanda, weapons, and shuai jiao. After several days, the fighting competitions were halted because too many competitors were seriously injured. Two died. Since the fights were stopped prematurely, 12 martial artists have historically been remembered as \\\"the champion\\\". Chu Guiting was one of them. During the 1950s, Chu Guiting settled in Shanghai and began to teach classes in Waitan Park, Fuxing Park, and the Peoples\u2019 Park. He also taught classes for a wide range of companies including the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Government's Public Security Department, the Shanghai Electric Cable Factory, the Poplar Tree Beach Power Plant, and the Eternal Peace Company. In 1958, Chu Guiting was invited to become the Chinese National Martial Arts Committee's Assistant Director. Following this, he was invited with Wang Ziping and Lu Zhenduo to choreograph a sword dance for the Shanghai Song and Dance Institution, which won a silver medal at the World Youth Festival. In 1956, Chu Guiting, Cai Longyun, Fu Zhongwen, and Zhang Yu were commissioned by the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Education Union to condense and simplify Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist) into a general system that could be conveniently studied by the masses. Shortly afterwards, Chu Guiting, Gu Liuxin, and Fu Zhongwen were invited to Beijing to formulate the famous Simplified 24 and 28 Step Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist), forms that are still practiced throughout China today. Chu Guiting was a renowned teacher. It was his belief that in order to learn martial arts one must harmonize the body, the breath, and the mind. Many Chinese martial artists trace their lineage back to Chu Guiting, and he taught artists from other styles. For example, he taught Xingyiquan, Baguazhang, and Taijiquan to Chan Yik Yan. In teaching, Chu Guiting paid particular attention to the moral philosophy of Chinese martial arts, and would often say: \\\"With morals much can be achieved, without them nothing can be achieved. Consider, for example, somebody who studies a martial art but does not recognize its moral and philosophical depth. They will soon give it up because they have only ever tasted the skin of the grape and not the fruit that it contains.\\\" Chu Guiting died on 16 February 1977.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "MartialArtist", "wiki_name": "Chu_Guiting", "word_count": 634, "label": "Martial Artist", "people": "Chu Guiting"}

Field was born in Hackney in 1786, his father was John Field a corn and seed merchant who was later to become Master of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors. Field was a pupil of dockyard engineer Simon Goodrich from 1803 to 1805. Commissioned by Samuel Bentham, the Inspector-general of naval works, he worked with Samuel Goodrich to develop tools for mass-producing ships' blocks at Portsmouth Dockyard. The block mills they designed required ten unskilled men to take the place of 110 skilled craftsmen, and have been recognised as the first use of machine tools for mass production. They were built by Henry Maudslay between 1802 and 1806, and represented the first steam-powered manufactory in any dockyard. He then joined Maudslay to form the firm of Messrs. Maudslay, Sons and Field of Lambeth. One of their projects was to build engines for the SS Great Western's Atlantic crossing of 1838. He was a prolific engineer working with the Atlantic Telegraph Company on machinery for cable laying, the Metropolitan Board of Works on sewage systems and Isambard Kingdom Brunel on his steamships. Field joined seven other young engineers who, in 1817, decided to found the Institution of Civil Engineers as a more accessible institution than the established but \u00e9litist Society of Civil Engineers founded by John Smeaton in 1771. He served as their vice-president in 1837, and he continued to hold that office until elected president on 18 January 1848, being the first mechanical engineer to hold the presidency and the only one of the original proposers to hold the post. In his inaugural address, delivered on 1 February, he alluded particularly to the changes which had then been introduced into steam navigation which allowed for a greater capacity and speeds. On 3 March 1836 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and was also a member of the Society of Arts.

He is currently Course Director for BA Fashion Design at the University of Westminster, where he has lectured since 2001. He also works as a creative director, stylist and writer. Groves is remembered for his controversial catwalk shows. In the 1990s, he designed under the label \\\"Jimmy Jumble\\\". The confrontational themes of his collections for London Fashion Week ensured that he caught people's attention and enhanced his notoriety. His first scheduled show, \\\"Ourselves Alone\\\" (translated from the Gaelic \\\"Sinn F\u00e9in\\\") referred to The Troubles in Ireland, combining the colours of the rival factions of Irish unionists and Irish republicians. The models wore orange sashes, grey suits, and charred green taffeta, with one model apparently setting herself on fire during the show. Outside the show 30 foot burning crucifixes were erected. Another show, \\\"Cocaine Nights\\\", (named after J.G. Ballard's novel, and also inspired by the film Face/Off ) had the models walking on a catwalk apparently spread with sugar-like cocaine. One dress was made of razor blades. At the time, Bill Clinton, the then President of the USA, had condemned the fashion industry for glamorizing drug use, so this was seen as deliberate provocation. Groves is known for his tailoring, and before he launched his own label, he worked as head assistant to Alexander McQueen for several years. In addition to his runway collections, Groves has created costumes for Robbie Williams, Kylie Minogue, Suede, and The Spice Girls.

{"text": "Roger Henri Vivier (13 November 1903 - 3 October 1998) was a French fashion designer who specialized in shoes. His best known creation was the Stiletto heel. Vivier has been called the \\\"Fragonard of the shoe\\\" and his shoes \\\"the Faberg\u00e9 of Footwear\\\" by numbers of critics. He designed extravagant richly-decorated shoes that he described as sculptures. He is credited with the design of the first stiletto heel in 1954. Stiletto heels, the very thin high heel, were certainly around in the late 19th century as numerous fetish drawings attest, but Vivier is known for reviving and developing this opulent style by using a thin rod of steel. Ava Gardner, Gloria Guinness and The Beatles were all Vivier customers, and he designed the shoes for Queen Elizabeth II for her coronation in 1953. Vivier designed shoes for Christian Dior from 1953 to 1963. In addition to the stiletto heel, he also experimented with other shapes including the comma. He used silk, pearls, beads, lace, appliqu\u00e9 and jewels to create unique decorations for his shoes. In the 1960s Vivier also designed silk-satin knee boots outlined in jewels, and thigh-high evening boots in a black elastic knit with beads. His most iconic design, the Pilgrim pumps with silver buckles (worn by Catherine Deneuve in the film Belle de Jour) received international publicity and many imitations. Visitors flock to his boutique on the Rue Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, whose design is famous for being inspired by Vivier's apartment. The collection is designed by Bruno Frisoni. Exclusivity is the hallmark of the line, with many shoes made to order, some with hand-embroidered gold thread. There are now three shops in the US. The latest opened in Orange County, CA in May 2012. Vivier's shoes are on display at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto and the Mus\u00e9e du Costume et de la Mode at the Louvre.

In 1855, he presented a well received paper on the merits of iron truss bridges to the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science (later the Royal Society of Victoria). Other works he designed included 17 miles of the railway from Newcastle to Maitland, New South Wales prior to 1858, the design and construction of the Melbourne and Essendon Railway in 1859, and works for the Yarra Yarra Mining Company, and Sandridge Lagoon, Port Melbourne. Bell was responsible for a number of fairly similar wrought iron lattice truss road and rail bridges, several of which were fabricated from components supplied by Messrs. Lloyds, Fosters, and Company's Wednesbury, Old Park Ironworks, Staffordshire. The West Maitland Bridge was the sixth bridge this firm exported for Bell, with the others including the Hawthorn Railway Bridge and Hawthorn Road Bridge over the River Yarra, in Melbourne, and the Gundagai, Pitnacree, and Dunmore bridges in New South Wales. His expertise was sought for a number of Melbourne civic works projects as he gave evidence to the Victorian Royal Commissions on the River and Harbour Trust in 1858 and 1860, and to the Select Committees on the Railway Department in 1860 and on the Central Railway Terminus in 1861 and in the same year was a member of the Royal Society of Victoria's Sanitary Committee.

Gore (May 3, 1854 \u2013 September 16, 1933), nicknamed \\\"Piano Legs\\\", was an American center fielder in Major League Baseball who played for 14 seasons, eight for the Chicago White Stockings, five for the New York Giants, one for the St. Louis Browns (1892) of the National League (NL), and the New York Giants of the Players' League (1890). Born in Saccarappa, Maine, Gore led the NL in several seasonal offensive categories. He won his only batting title in 1880 while playing for Chicago, along with league leading totals in on-base percentage and slugging percentage. He also led the league twice in runs scored, bases on balls three times, and games played by a center fielder once. Gore was also the all-time leader for most errors by major league outfielder upon his retirement with 368 total, including a record 346 errors in the National League, records he still holds today. (He made 217 errors for Chicago; 122 for New York; and seven for St. Louis, all National League teams; and 22 for the New York Giants of the Players' League.) Gore played for many successful teams throughout his career. During his eight seasons with the White Stockings, they won the league title five times, including appearances in two World Series. Chicago played the St. Louis Browns in both 1885, which ended in a series tie, and 1886, with St. Louis winning the championship. He was also a member of the New York Giants' two National League championship teams in 1888 and 1889. Both Giants teams went on to claim World Series victories, against the St. Louis Browns in 1888, and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms in 1889. Twice he set single-game records, one for stealing seven bases, and the other for collecting five extra-base hits. Although he had statistics that put him consistently among the seasonal league leaders, he reportedly had a poor work ethic resulting from an active social life outside of baseball. This behavior did not endear him to his team captain, Cap Anson, which caused them to feud during Gore's time in Chicago. After his career, he had major financial difficulties, having to move from job to job to just support his bare necessities.

{"text": "Al Zerhusen (born December 4, 1931 in Brooklyn, New York) is a former U.S. soccer midfielder who played extensively for the U.S. national team. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. When Zerhusen was five, his family moved from New York to Germany where he learned to play soccer. He moved back to the U.S. in 1950 and settled in Cincinnati, Ohio. However, he was soon after drafted into the Army. After a period stationed in Germany, Zerhusen was transferred back to a base in Cincinnati. In 1954, he played for the Armed Forces soccer team in Cincinnati. At the time soccer was not a truly professional sport in the U.S. so when Zerhusen left the Army, he remained an amateur with the Cincinnati Kolping Soccer Club. In 1956, he was selected for the U.S. team which competed in the 1956 Summer Olympics. The Olympic tournament in 1956 was single game elimination and the U.S. lost 9-1 to Yugoslavia in the first game, Zerhusen scoring for the U.S. However, in preparation for the games, the U.S. had played several exhibition matches and Zerhusen scored seventeen goals in nine games leading up to the Olympics. While many sources show Zerhusen\u2019s national team career beginning in 1954, none of the U.S. games played during this year are counted by USSF or FIFA as full internationals. It wasn\u2019t until the April 7, 1957 6-0 thrashing at the hands of Mexico in a 1958 World Cup Qualifier that Zerhusen earned his first official cap with the U.S. national team. After losing all four qualifying games, two to Mexico and two to Canada, the next U.S. game was an 8-1 loss to England in 1959. However, that year saw greater success for the U.S. at the Pan American games. In the 1959 Pan American Games, the U.S. took the bronze behind ten goals by Zerhusen, including four goals in the game against Haiti. A month later the U.S. began qualifications for the 1960 Summer Olympics, but was quickly eliminated with a loss and a tie to Mexico.In 1960, Zerhusen scored his only goal in a full international when he tied Mexico 3-3 in a 1962 FIFA World Cup qualifier. However, Mexico won the game in Mexico and the U.S. had yet again failed to qualify for a major tournament. Zerhusen continued to play for the U.S. into 1965, earning a total of nine caps, but never again scoring. By this time, Zerhusen had established himself as one of the top amateur midfielders in the U.S. He was the captain of the Los Angeles Kickers for ten years. In both 1958 and 1964, the Kickers won the National Challenge Cup. The Kickers also made it to the 1960 National Cup finals, but fell to the Ukrainian Nationals that year. In 1961, Zerhusen was with the Los Angeles Scots who also fell to the Ukrainian Nationals in the title series. The Scots lost 7-4 on aggregate, with Zerhusen scoring all four of the Scots\u2019 goals. Over his years with the Kickers and the Scots, Zerhusen was the Greater Los Angeles Soccer League\u2019s leading scorer 13 times. In 1978, Zerhusen was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

He has worked as a postman, scrap dealer, illusionist, and was the Norwegian champion of magic. He has held talks for companies and has been involved in debates. He has also been the host of children's television programmes in Norway and for a time he had a permanent role as part of the long-running NRK program Norge rundt. Starting in 1980, he was a member of the municipality council in his home city of Stavanger. Today he is the leader of the Eiganes og V\u00e5land city district council for the Liberal Party of Norway. He was only 15 years old when he was first noticed in the national media. He fooled all of Norway's archaeologists by placing five Chinese coins from the 10th century in an excavation field in Stavanger. In the end of the 1960s, Stavanger prison and some other buildings in the market area of Stavanger were torn down, and at the same time archaeologists were excavating. Stavanger museum sent out press releases about the find, and soon the discovery was known around the world. But after some time, Torkelsen contacted regional newspaper Stavanger Aftenblad in order to tell the truth about the coins. Oddmund M\u00f8llerop, the director of the Stavanger archaeological museum at the time, has said that Torkelsen had planted the coins in the perfect spot. The coins happened to be planted in a location where the age of the land that the archaeologists were excavating was precisely the same age as the coins. Had the coins been placed anywhere else in the excavation site, the archaeologists would have been able to tell that they were planted there. Torkelsen is also known as a talented spokesperson for smokers and he has many times played around with this theme. He is also known for collecting comic books and owns one of Norway's biggest collections with over 28,000 books. Most of them are displayed in the children's museum in Stavanger.

In addition to all this, he has had success with the variety show group L\u00f8gnaslaget (together with Dag Schreiner and Steinar Lyse). The group has also released music.

{"text": "Philipp Veit (13 February 1793 \u2013 18 December 1877) was a German Romantic painter. To Veit is due the credit of having been the first to revive the almost forgotten technique of fresco painting. Veit was born in Berlin, Prussia. He was the son of a banker Simon Veit and his wife Dorothea, daughter of Moses Mendelssohn, who subsequently left him to marry Friedrich Schlegel. Veit received his first art education in Dresden, where he was taught by Caspar David Friedrich, and Vienna. Although a prodigious talent when it came to drawing, Veit was not comfortable with oil painting. Therefore, in Vienna he took to working with watercolor. In Vienna, he made the acquaintance of Schlegel, and through him came to know several Viennese Romantics, one of whom was the poet and novelist Joseph von Eichendorff. He was strongly influenced by, and joined, the Nazarene movement in Rome, where he worked for some years before moving to Frankfurt. Veit participated in the struggle against Napoleon in 1813-14, returning to Berlin for a short period. In 1815, he finished the Virgin with Christ and St John, a votive painting for the church of St James in Heiligenstadt, Vienna. The painting was inspired by the style of Pietro Perugino and Raphael. In Frankfurt, where his most important works are preserved at the St\u00e4del, he was active from 1830 to 1843 as director of the art collections and as professor of painting. From 1853 till his death in 1877 he held the post of director of the municipal gallery in Mainz. Like his fellow Nazarenes he was more draughtsman than painter, and though his sense of colour was stronger than that of Overbeck or Cornelius, his works are generally more of the nature of coloured cartoons than of paintings in the modern sense. Veit's principal work is the large fresco of The Introduction of Christianity into Germany by St Boniface, at the St\u00e4del. In the Frankfurt Cathedral is his Assumption, while the Alte Nationalgalerie of Berlin has his painting of The Two Marys at the Sepulchre. An example of his romantic work is Germania, a national personification of Germany, located in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum of Nuremberg.

Born in Aachen, Germany, Pavel went to S\u00e3o Paulo when he was 6 years old, brought by his father who went to work for the Matarazzo industries. It was in Brazil, in 1972, that he invented his device, the stereobelt. He lived in a modern house in Morumbi, and was acquainted to some important personalities of the time, as the journalist Vladimir Herzog and the poet Augusto de Campos Over the next few years he tried to interest companies like Grundig, Philips, and Yamaha in manufacturing it. In 1977, Pavel filed a patent in Italy on the device, followed by patents in the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, and Japan. He moved to Milan aged 30 years. In 1979, Sony began selling the popular Walkman, and in 1980 started legal talks with Pavel regarding a royalty fee. In 1986 Sony finally agreed to pay royalties to Pavel, but only for sales in Germany, and only for a few models, and refused to acknowledge him as the inventor of the device. In 1989, Andreas Pavel started new proceedings, this time going through the law courts in the UK. Seven years later, the case was dismissed and Pavel was left with $3.6 million of debt for his court costs. Then in 2001, Pavel threatened Sony with legal suits in every country in which he had patented his invention. The corporation agreed to resume talks with Pavel and a settlement was finally reached in 2003. The exact settlement fee is a closely guarded secret, but European press accounts said that Pavel received a cash settlement for damages in excess of $10,000,000 and is now also receiving royalties on some Walkman sales. The settlement also includes a clause which will prevent Pavel from bringing future lawsuits. The settlement grants Pavel the recognition from Sony that he was the original inventor of the Walkman; this apparently could only be achieved after the death of Akio Morita, the founder of Sony and previously-recognised creator of the personal stereo. Pavel reportedly had considered asking manufacturers of MP3 music players for royalties, including Apple (for their popular iPod player). However, in December 2005 he said he did not intend to do so, not wishing to spend further time fighting lawsuits.

She was the first woman to serve as Commissioner of New York City\u2019s Department of Health (1954\u20131962). She was a strong advocate of health education and a pioneer in promoting health services among New York\u2019s immigrant and poverty-stricken population. Leona Baumgartner was born in 1902 to Olga and William Baumgartner. She earned her B.A in Bacteriology and M.A in Immunology at the University of Kansas where her father was a professor of zoology. She was a member of the Kansas Alpha chapter of Pi Beta Phi She was the 1933-34 winner of the Pi Beta Phi Graduate Fellowship Moving onto Yale University, Baumgartner received her Ph.D. in Public Health in 1934 and received her M.D. the same year. From 1934\u20131936, she interned in Pediatrics at New York City Hospital. It was during this time, in depression-era New York, that Baumgartner began making home visits in the city\u2019s poorest areas. In 1937, She joined New York\u2019s Department of Health as a medical instructor in Child and School Hygiene. In 1939, Baumgartner was promoted to district health officer, where she managed a number of health services including school health programs, parenting classes and clinics on venereal disease. In 1954, Baumgartner was appointed Commissioner of Health of New York City. In addition to revising the city\u2019s health code, she also implemented routine inspections of the city\u2019s many restaurant kitchens, slaughterhouses and day-care facilities. She was instrumental in garnering funding for public health research and a premature childcare facility. Following in the work of Sara Josephine Baker, Baumgartner sought to increase public knowledge of health issues through a series of radio and television broadcasts. On October 28, 1956, she assisted Dr. Harold Fuerst in the inoculation of the then 21 year old Elvis Presley, an event witnessed by the entire world press with bureaus in New York City, carried live on all three networks and which resulted in the exponential increase in the polio immunization of all Americans from 0.6%, the prevailing rate on the previous day, to 80% by April 1957. As the years went buy, maternal and child health remained a constant concern throughout her career and informed her decision to promote family planning practices and birth control. In 1962, she was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at the United States Agency for International Development. Under the Johnson administration she fought to overturn policies that prevented the inclusion of birth control in the agency\u2019s health programs. She is credited with convincing President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse policy on funding for international programs that provided birth control. In 1965, Baumgartner accepted a position as a visiting professor at Harvard Medical School. She remained at this post until her retirement in 1972. During the same years, she also served as Executive Director of the Medical Care and Education Foundation. Throughout her career, Baumgartner was dedicated to health education as the cornerstone to the creation of a healthy community, beginning with her work as district health officer in planning classes and clinics. Baumgartner was also an early advocate of the vaccine developed by Jonas Salk as a method of immunization against polio and the fluoridation of water as a bulwark against dental disease. Baumgartner was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969. She was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1977. Her other awards include the Sedgwick Medal, the Albert Lasker Public Service Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, and the Samuel J. Crumbine Award.

As of 2 November 2015, he is ranked the #6 welterweight in the world by GLORY. Originally from Suriname, Murthel began his kickboxing career fighting on small shows in the Netherlands. He made his SLAMM debut in 2006, losing both of his fights with the organization, including a decision loss to Leroy Kaestner at B-Klass level. In 2008, Murthel was invited by the K-1 organization to take part in an eight-man tournament, which had originally been intended for heavyweights but was changed later for fighters around the 75 kg bracket. Murthel won the competition in spectacular fashion, dispatching all three of his opponents by stoppage on the night to take the title in Milan. The performance at the K-1 tournament led to Murthel being invited to take part in a fight within the It's Showtime organization \u2013 the Netherlands biggest kickboxing organization. He lost his debut to It's Showtime Reality winner Sem Braan but impressed enough to be invited back for further matches. Although an impressive fighter with a good knockout ratio, Murthel has had up and down performances within the organization, winning fights against the likes of Yassin Boudrouz and Joep Beerenpoot by knockout, but losing to Vladimir Moravcik and being knocked out by Ali Cenik, fights he should have been expected to do better in. Murthel has also fought and lost to top class fighters such as Cosmo Alexandre and Nieky Holzken \u2013 with the loss against Holzken after an extension round, being slightly unfortunate for some who felt Murthel deserved more. Despite some inconsistent performances, Murthel won the vacant E.M.T.A. European title at the start of 2010, defeating Amir Zeyada in an impressive showing. He ventured up to the 79 kg division to face Marc de Bonte at Glory 2: Brussels on October 6, 2012 in Brussels, Belgium and scored another come-from-behind victory as he knocked his opponent out with a knee strike in the second round.

{"text": "James Bryant Conant (March 26, 1893 \u2013 February 11, 1978) was an American chemist, a transformative President of Harvard University, and the first U.S. Ambassador to West Germany. Conant obtained a PhD in Chemistry from Harvard in 1916. During World War I he served in the U.S. Army, working on the development of poison gases. He became an assistant professor of chemistry at Harvard in 1919, and the Sheldon Emery Professor of Organic Chemistry in 1929. He researched the physical structures of natural products, particularly chlorophyll, and he was one of the first to explore the sometimes complex relationship between chemical equilibrium and the reaction rate of chemical processes. He studied the biochemistry of oxyhemoglobin providing insight into the disease methemoglobinemia, helped to explain the structure of chlorophyll, and contributed important insights that underlie modern theories of acid-base chemistry. In 1933, Conant became the President of Harvard University with a reformist agenda that involved dispensing with a number of customs, including class rankings and the requirement for Latin classes. He abolished athletic scholarships, and instituted an \\\"up or out\\\" policy, under which scholars who were not promoted were terminated. His egalitarian vision of education required a diversified student body, and he promoted the adoption of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and co-educational classes. During his presidency, women were admitted to Harvard Medical School and Harvard Law School for the first time. Conant was appointed to the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) in 1940, becoming its chairman in 1941. In this capacity, he oversaw vital wartime research projects, including the development of synthetic rubber, and the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bombs. On July 16, 1945, he was among the dignitaries present at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range for the Trinity nuclear test, the first detonation of an atomic bomb, and was part of the Interim Committee that advised President Harry S. Truman to use atomic bombs on Japan. After the war, he served on the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDC) that was established to coordinate burgeoning defense research, and on the influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). In his later years at Harvard, Conant taught undergraduate courses on the history and philosophy of science, and wrote books explaining the scientific method to laymen. In 1953 he retired as President of Harvard and became the United States High Commissioner for Germany, overseeing the restoration of German sovereignty after World War II, and then was Ambassador to West Germany until 1957. On returning to the United States, he criticized the education system in works such as The American High School Today (1959), Slums and Suburbs (1961) and The Education of American Teachers (1963). Between 1965 and 1969, Conant, suffering from a heart condition, worked on his autobiography, My Several Lives (1970).

{"text": "Christopher C. Faust (born 1955 in Fort Riley, Kansas) is a prolific landscape photographer in St. Paul, Minnesota. He holds a degree in biology from St. Cloud State University and an MS in Educational Media from St. Cloud State University. He is best known for his panoramic photographs of landscapes. From 1990 to 1996 he created a series of black-and-white images of new suburban development, especially in Minnesota, USA. Many of these depict new structures and spaces not yet fully formed, and not yet inhabited by people. A frequent theme in these and other series is the intersection of human beings with nature, and places where the two interact in visually provocative ways. An example is \\\"The Edge, Eden Prairie, MN\\\" which is in the collection of the Walker Art Center. This photograph appears to be a split, double image, but is actually a single scene, depicting where a suburban development near Minneapolis, Minnesota runs up against prairie vegetation. The imported, landscaped vegetation, especially the central tree, conifers, and lawn grass balance the smaller native tree and prairie grass of the other half, as the condominiums loom from a corner. Other of his series include outdoor industrial scenes typical of the northern Midwest, like grain elevators and railcars, rural landscapes from Minnesota and Appalachia, and color photographs of natural scenes. Faust's work is exhibited regularly in galleries around Minnesota. His work appears in a number of restaurants and coffee shops in the St. Paul area, and is held by the permanent collections of the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Weisman Art Museum, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Twenty of Faust's photographs, many of them from his Suburban Documentation Project, illustrate the 1997 book Placing Nature: Culture and Landscape Ecology, edited by landscape architect Joan Iverson Nassauer, and including essays by novelist Jane Smiley and philosopher Marcia Muelder Eaton. Faust has been honored with McKnight Foundation Fellowships in 1989, 1992, and 1997. Faust is now a media teacher at a catholic school in South Minneapolis.

{"text": "William Cyril \\\"Bill\\\" Marshall DFC SCM (14 August 1918 \u2013 1 November 2005) was a Thoroughbred horse racing trainer and owner who had the distinction of being the only person to have saddled winners from stables on four different continents. Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Bill Marshall was raised on a farm near Chichester where he developed his love of horses. In his early teens, he left home and made his way to Australia where he worked as a jockey for a short time before turning to training. While still only seventeen years old he headed to South Africa where he operated his own stable for a few years until the outbreak of World War II. Marshall returned to his native England and joined the Royal Air Force. In the war, Marshall, while flying back from a mission over France, realised that he was going to be very late for a date in Buckinghamshire. He was supposed to land at Tangmere, in Sussex, but diverted to Marlow, where his date awaited him in the Compleat Angler Inn. His daredevil act of flying his Spitfire under Marlow Bridge (headway Marlow Bridge = 3.86 metres, Spitfire height = 3.86 metres) and performing a roll impressed his girlfriend, but not an air commodore who happened to be in the bar. A report was filed, but Marshall escaped a court martial because it was wartime. As a pilot, he fought in the Battle of Britain thence served with 253 squadron in North Africa before returning to England to serve in the famous 91 'Nigeria' Squadron. By the time the war ended, Marshall had been shot down twice and was the recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross as well as mentioned in dispatches. Discharged from the military, Marshall remained in England and began training National Hunt horses then Thoroughbreds for flat racing. In 1972 a small plane carrying Marshall and his wife Pamela, along with jockey Joe Mercer and racehorse-owner John Howard, crashed after taking off from Newbury Racecourse. The pilot died in the crash but although they were seriously injured, Marshall and his wife and the other passengers survived. In 1981, the sixty-three-old Marshall and his wife Pamela moved to Barbados where he would become one of the most important figures in that country's horse racing industry. Among his successes at Garrison Savannah Racetrack, Bill Marshall was a seven-time winner of the island's most prestigious race, the Barbados Gold Cup and a nine-time winner of the Barbados Derby. In 1989 he conditioned Barbados Triple Crown champion, Coo Bird, who would win more races in his career than any other Thoroughbred in Barbados horse racing history. In all, Marshall won twenty-two Barbadian Triple Crown races and earned champion trainer honors eleven times. In 1994 \\\"The Art and Science of Racehorse Training: the \\\"Bill\\\" Marshall Guide\\\" by Michael W. Marshall was published by Keepdate Publishing, with an introduction by Jack Berry. In 2003, Bill Marshall's biography titled You Win Some, You Lose Some was published. That same year, the government of Barbados honored his contribution to horse racing with the Silver Crown of Merit. Bill Marshall remained active in racing and was still winning at the time of his death in 2005 at the age of eighty-seven.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "HorseTrainer", "wiki_name": "William_C._Marshall", "word_count": 541, "label": "Horse Trainer", "people": "William C.

She was born in London, daughter and sixth of eleven children of Rowland Hunt (1828-1878) of Boreatton Park, Baschurch, a village in west Shropshire, England, and his wife, Florence Marianne, eldest daughter of Richard Buckley Humfrey of Stoke Albany, Northamptonshire, England. Hunt was brought up at Boreatton Park until 1882, then at Kibworth Hall, Leicestershire before her widowed mother took the children to Australia, where they lived on a small farmstead. She was disabled from osteomyelitis of the hip that she suffered from as a child following septicaemia. In 1887, she returned to England and began training as a \\\"lady pupil\\\" nurse at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Rhyl, Wales. She opened a convalescent home, attached to the Salop Infirmary at Shrewsbury, for crippled children at Florence House (a family property) in Baschurch in 1900 which espoused the theory of open-air treatment. In 1901, she sought treatment for her own condition from a Liverpool surgeon, Robert Jones. She invited him to visit the convalescent home and he eventually began travelling there on a regular basis to provide treatment to the children. By 1907, they had built an operating theatre and they introduced the diagnostic use of X-rays in 1913. In 1910 it was approved as a training school by the Chartered Society of Massage and during World War I, Florence House was used to treat wounded soldiers. In 1918, Hunt was awarded the Royal Red Cross for her contribution during the war. In 1919, the British Red Cross Society and the Shropshire War Memorial Fund provided financing to move the facility, renamed the Shropshire Orthopaedic Hospital, to a former military hospital at Park Hall, near Gobowen, Oswestry. The hospital also provided training for nurses. Later, a school begun for the children developed into a training college for disabled adults, Derwen College. The hospital was used once again to treat wounded soldiers during World War II. Following an extensive fire in 1948, the hospital underwent a period of reconstruction and expansion, developing into what is now called The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Scientist", "l3": "Medician", "wiki_name": "Agnes_Hunt", "word_count": 370, "label": "Medician", "people": "Agnes Hunt"}
{"text": "Owen Luder, CBE (born 7 August 1928) is an English architect who designed a number of notable and sometimes controversial buildings in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s, many now demolished. He is a former chairman of the Architects Registration Board and president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He established his own practice Owen Luder Partnership in 1957, and left in 1987 to form the consultancy Communication In Construction. Owen Luder's designs included some of the most powerful and raw examples of Brutalist architecture, with massive bare concrete sculptural forms devoid of claddings or decoration - other than their inherent shapes. The British climate, with abundant rain and damp winters, is unkind to such unclad concrete buildings which rapidly become a shabby grey\u2013brown colour and streaked with marks where rainwater has run down the fa\u00e7ades. Poor maintenance has often exacerbated these problems. Some of the Owen Luder Partnership's best known buildings are the Tricorn Centre in Portsmouth, Derwent Tower in Gateshead and Catford shopping centre in London, which is being considered for demolition. Trinity Square in Gateshead (whose multi-storey car park featured in the 1971 gangster movie Get Carter) was another one of the practice's major schemes, demolition of which began in January 2009. Luder also designed the much-derided Southgate shopping centre in Bath, Somerset, which has recently been demolished to make way for a new multimillion-pound development. Despite receiving awards when built, the Tricorn Centre was voted the third ugliest building in Britain and was demolished in 2004 to mixed reactions and protests from an unrepentant Luder. The Trinity Square car park has also been subject to a number of redevelopment proposals and featured in the Channel 4 series Demolition in 2005. Luder featured in the 2005 BBC Radio 3 broadcast 'Gateshead Multi-Storey Car Park'. A radiophonic tribute to Trinity Square, produced by Langham Research Centre, the programme was made entirely from the sounds of the carpark, processed and treated on quarter-inch tape. Luder also designed the conversion of a Victorian fire station into the South London Theatre in 1967. In addition he designed a number of small houses in the borough of Lambeth including 26-28 Groveway (1953) and 76-78 Herne Hill Road (1954), one of the latter was occupied by Luder upon completion. Trinity Square in Gateshead is now demolished, and Derwent Tower demolished in 2012. The Catford Centre, Luder's last surviving town centre of the Tricorn type, was purchased by the local council in 2010 for \\\"regeneration\\\", which may involve demolition of the housing on the site.

{"text": "Andrew Eden Soltis (born May 28, 1947 in Hazleton, Pennsylvania) is an American chess Grandmaster, author and columnist. Soltis learned how the chess pieces moved at age 10 when he came upon a how-to-play book in the public library in Astoria, Queens where he grew up. He took no further interest in the game until he was 14, when he joined an Astoria chess club, then the Marshall Chess Club and competed in his first tournament, the 1961 New York City Junior Championship. He has written a weekly chess column for the New York Post since 1972. His monthly column \\\"Chess to Enjoy\\\" in Chess Life, the official publication of the United States Chess Federation, was begun in 1979 and is the longest running column in that magazine. He was named \\\"Chess Journalist of the Year\\\" in 1988 and 2002 by the Chess Journalists of America. Soltis was one of the few Americans in the 20th century who earned the International Grandmaster title but was not a professional chess player. He worked as a news reporter and editor for the New York Post from 1969 until he retired in 2014. He began writing a weekly chess column for the Post in 1972 and continued it after he retired. He is considered one of the most prolific chess writers, having authored or coauthored more than 100 books and opening monographs about chess. His books have been translated into Spanish, French, German, Italian and Polish. In 2014 his work Mikhail Botvinnik, The Life and Games of a World Chess Champion was named Book of the Year by the Chess Journalists of America and the English Chess Federation.Other honors for his books include the 1994 British Chess Federation award for Frank Marshall, United States Champion and the Cramer Award in 2006 for Soviet Chess 1917-1991 and in 2006 for Why Lasker Matters Soltis has been inactive in tournaments since 2002. He reached his playing peak as a competitive player when he was rated the 74th best player in the world, in January 1971. He was inducted into the United States Chess Hall of Fame in September 2011.He tied for first prize in the 1977 and 1982 U.S. Open Championships.

He was also a member of the silver-medal winning U.S. teams in the 14th and the 18th World Student Team Championships. Soltis won the annual international tournament at Reggio Emilia, Italy in 1972 and was awarded the International Master title two years later. His first-place finishes in New York international tournaments in 1977 and 1980 resulted in his being awarded the International Grandmaster title in 1980. He won the championship of the prestigious Marshall Chess Club a record nine times, in 1967, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1974, 1977, 1979, 1986, and 1989. He also competed in four U.S. (closed) Championships, 1974, 1977, 1978 and 1983.

Previous experience showed that Black often got mated if he allowed 13 h5. He also gave names to chess openings such as the Nimzo-Larsen Attack, the Baltic Defense and the Chameleon Sicilian. Several names for pawn structures and moves, such as the Marco Hop and the Boleslavsky Hole, were popularized by his book Pawn Structure Chess. He introduced the Russian chess term priyome to English literature in Studying Chess Made Easy. Soltis graduated from City College of New York in 1969.

At the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games 1996 and 2004 he was the flag bearer of the Belgian team. For the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, the 20 highest ranked ITTF players were to be selected for the Olympics. Saive expected to be selected as he was tied in 20th position together with the Swede J\u00f6rgen Persson and there was no rule to decide what to do in case of ties. The ITTF decided they needed to play an extra playoff to determine who got the last spot.However, they refused to play as they agreed they should both get a ticket. The ITTF then recalculated the rankings and placed Persson in 20th position and Saive in 21st. Eventually, Saive did play an extra qualification tournament in Budapest, finishing third and thus qualified for his seventh successive Summer Olympics. Both Saive and Persson, along with Croatian Zoran Primorac, were the first only table tennis players to compete at seven Olympics, having been at all Games since the sport was introduced in 1988. His successes made him the best Belgian table tennis player. He is also considered to be one of Belgium's most prolific athletes as he was elected as Sports Personality of the Year 1991 and 1994.

Makiyama started bud\u014d at the age of 18 in 1947 after enlisting in the U.S. Army. He was sent to Japan and was stationed in Yokohama, where he was assigned to the 8th Army\u2019s military police criminal investigation division. At the Isezaki-cho police station in Yokohama he started to train in police judo. Over the years, he studied judo, jujutsu, G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b karate and aikido among other bud\u014d arts. In aikido, he achieved eighth dan (1977) in Yoshinkan aikido and a certification as shihan. He is believed to be the only American with that distinction at the time. He also contributed to a number of articles for martial arts publications such as Black Belt magazine. Makiyama was the author of one of the first books in English on Aikido in 1960 and the book Keijutsukai Aikido in 1983. In Hawaii, Makiyama was instrumental in forming the first official branch of the Aikido Yoshinkai outside Japan, at the personal request of the late Gozo Shioda, a close friend and professional acquaintance since 1948. Makiyama created the Keijutsukai (Police/Security Techniques Association) in February 1980 after training as an independent system commenced during the early part of 1979. He was the Keijutsukai Director until his death on September 9, 2005.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "MartialArtist", "wiki_name": "Thomas_H._Makiyama", "word_count": 250, "label": "Martial Artist", "people": "Thomas H.

With Michael Denis, also a teacher at the Theresianum, he published the first index of the Lepidoptera of the Viennese region das Systematische Verzeichnis der Schmetterlinge der Wienergegend herausgegeben von einigen Lehrern am k. k.

{"text": "Kenji Tomiki (March 15, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1979) was a Japanese aikido and judo teacher and the founder of competitive aikido (aikido kyogi) style. The style is referred by several names including Tomiki Aikido, Shodokan Aikido and Sport Aikido. Tomiki was one of the early students of the founder of aikido Morihei Ueshiba, beginning in 1926, and also of Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo. In 1928 he obtained 5th dan in judo and in the following year he represented Miyagi Prefecture in the first judo tournament held in front of the Emperor\u2014this tournament became the All Japan Tournament the following year. From 1936 till the end of the second world war he lived in Manchukuo (Manchuria) where he taught aikibudo (an early name for aikido) to the Kanton army and the Imperial Household Agency. In 1938 he became an assistant professor at Kenkoku University in Manchukuo. He went on to be awarded the first 8th dan in aikido (1940) and an 8th dan in judo (1978). After returning from a three-year internment by the Soviet Union, he taught both judo and aikido for many years at Waseda University. It was there that he formulated and expanded his theories concerning both kata based training methods and a particular form of free-style fighting which would put him at odds with much, but not all, of the aikido world. It was this action on the part of Tomiki of attempting to convert aikido into a sport that led to a schism with the founder Morihei Ueshiba and the Aikikai around this time. Tomiki was urged by the Aikikai to adopt a different name for his art other than \u201caikido\u201d if he intended to introduce such a system of competition. Convinced of the need to modernize aikido, he stood his ground and persisted in his efforts to evolve a viable form of competition. In 1953, Tomiki along with 9 other martial art instructors were selected to tour US Air Force bases in the United States and was thus the first aikido instructor to visit the US. Tomiki is perhaps best known in the judo world for his influence in the developing of Kodokan Goshin Jutsu kata. His work Judo, published in 1956, is considered a classic. The aikido appendix to the book is thought to be the earliest English language text on aikido. In 1967, Tomiki opened his Shodokan Dojo which he used as a testing ground for his theories on aikido and competition. In 1970, Tomiki retired from Waseda University and, in the same year, presided over the first All-Japan Student Aikido Tournament. The basic rules for the holding of aikido tournaments had been worked out by this time in what would become an ongoing experiment to develop a viable form of competitive aikido. In 1974, he founded the Japan Aikido Association (JAA) from an earlier organization of the same name to promote his theories. Tomiki set up a new dojo for the Shodokan in Osaka on March 28, 1976 with the support of Masaharu Uchiyama, Vice-Chairman of the J.A.A. This dojo was intended to function as the headquarters of the Japan Aikido Association and Tomiki served as its first director. The current head of the dojo and chief instructor of the Shodokan Aikido Federation is Tetsuro Nariyama. Professor Tomiki died on December 24, 1979 leaving his closest disciple, Hideo Ohba as head of the Japan Aikido Association (JAA).", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "MartialArtist", "wiki_name": "Kenji_Tomiki", "word_count": 572, "label": "Martial Artist", "people": "Kenji Tomiki"}

Anderssen is famous even today for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the \\\"Immortal Game\\\" (1851) and the \\\"Evergreen Game\\\" (1852). He was a very important figure in the development of chess problems, driving forward the transition from the \\\"Old School\\\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an \\\"elder statesman\\\" of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.

Hansen was born in 1989 in Takapuna on Auckland's North Shore. She grew up in Canterbury and played netball for the Canterbury Flames including trials at the national level. Her motivation for taking up track cycling during secondary school was to increase her fitness for netball. At her second national trials, she set new national records in sprint and 500 m, which qualified her for the 2007 UCI Juniors World Championships held in Aguascalientes, Mexico. This was her first international event and gained her a training place in World Cycling Centre in the French speaking part of Switzerland, to where she moved. Hansen moved back to New Zealand in the following year (2008) and moved to Invercargill to train at the Invercargill ILT Velodrome, then the base of the New Zealand cycling team. During her time there in the Southland city, she trained as an air traffic controller at Invercargill Airport. At the 2011 Oceania Cycling Championships, she gained titles in team sprint, keirin, and the 500 m event. This secured her a place at the 2012 Summer Olympics for the Keirin and the sprint. Her preparation was distracted by her best friend dying of cancer, and Hansen returned to New Zealand in July 2012 for the funeral. She came 12th in the sprint and 11th in the Keirin. She took 2013 off from competitive cycling and looked for another opportunity to keep herself fit. She took up boxing to train for a charity event in Christchurch. She competed in 'Fight for Christchurch 2013' in November, raising funds for the Ronald McDonald House South Island. The event itself raised in excess of $200,000 for selected charities. Hansen regained her motivation for track cycling and moved to Cambridge on 1 January 2015; the national team had relocated to the Avantidrome when it officially opened in April 2014. At the same time, she relocated to Hamilton Airport for work. She teamed up with Katie Schofield for the team sprint and came fourth at a World Cup meeting in Cali, Colombia, in January 2015. Hansen was competing with Schofield and Stephanie McKenzie for selection for the 2016 Rio Olympics when she came fifth in the individual sprint in March 2016 at the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in London, and this performance secured her place at her second Olympics. Hansen was confirmed by the New Zealand Olympic Committee as part of the first track cyclists chosen for Rio on 7 April 2016.

His natural position was shortstop, but he had the misfortune to be with the White Sox while Chico Carrasquel played the position, followed by all-time great Luis Aparicio. A native of Alqu\u00edzar, Cuba, Rodr\u00edguez played in the Negro Leagues with the New York Cubans, 1939 and 1944, and in the Mexican League, 1945\u201346 (Riley, 676) prior to the integration of organized baseball, Before the 1951 season, Rodr\u00edguez was acquired by the Brooklyn Dodgers from the Tuneros de San Luis Potos\u00ed of the Mexican League. He was assigned to Brooklyn's farm club, the Montreal Royals, where he batted .302. On December 6 of that same year he was traded by the Dodgers to the Chicago White Sox for first baseman Rocky Nelson. Rodr\u00edguez was Chicago's regular third baseman during the 1952 season. He appeared in 124 games for the 81\u201373 White Sox and hit .265 with 1 home run and 40 runs batted in. He drew 47 walks and was hit by pitches 3 times, raising his on-base percentage to .346. He stole 7 bases, scored 55 runs, and struck out just 22 times in 407 at bats, making him the seventh-toughest to strike out in the American League. (once per every 18.5 at bats) Defensively, his .959 fielding percentage was just above the league average for third basemen. Rodr\u00edguez went back to the minor leagues in 1953, and on October 8 of that year was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League for pitcher Don Johnson. While Rodr\u00edguez never again made it back to the big league level, he had an outstanding career with the Toronto Maple Leafs when they were the top-drawing team in the International League during the 1950s. He teamed with second baseman Mike Goliat to turn spectacular double plays. Rodr\u00edguez was so good at the position, the White Sox sent a film crew to Toronto to record his skill at turning double plays to be used in training their minor league shortstops.

He was France's most important pianist in the nineteenth century, apart from Chopin. Plant\u00e9 was born in Orthez. He studied piano under Antoine Marmontel, his career beginning at the age of seven in Paris. While there he met and befriended many like-minded musicians who would have a long-lasting effect on his career. These included Franz Liszt, with whom he played arrangements of two of Liszt's symphonic poems (Les Pr\u00e9ludes, and Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo) for 2 pianos, Hector Berlioz, Gioachino Rossini, Charles Gounod, Felix Mendelssohn, Sigismond Thalberg and Charles-Marie Widor. It is also known that he himself heard Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin play, and because of this, his recordings - and indeed the one film available of him - are seen as a link to a 'lost world' of piano performance. He toured the concert platforms of Europe after leaving Paris, expanding his reputation for quality of tone and virtuosic, emotional interpretations. The death of his wife in 1908 resulted in him retiring from the stage, except for charity performances and concerts in aid of those wounded in the First World War. He had many pupils, including Alexander Brailowsky. He died in Saint-Avit. Plant\u00e9 is featured in the 1999 DVD The Art of Piano, in which a short excerpt from the film of him playing Chopin's \u00c9tude in C, Op. 10 No. 7 can be seen.

Politically, Luce was a leading conservative in later life and was well known for her anti-communism. In her youth, she briefly aligned herself with the liberalism of President Franklin Roosevelt as a protege of Bernard Baruch, but later became an outspoken critic of Roosevelt. Although she was a strong supporter of the Anglo-American alliance in World War II, she remained outspokenly critical of British colonialism in India. Known as a charismatic and forceful public speaker, especially after her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1946, she campaigned for every Republican presidential candidate from Wendell Willkie to Ronald Reagan.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Ambassador", "wiki_name": "Clare_Boothe_Luce", "word_count": 179, "label": "Ambassador", "people": "Clare Boothe Luce"}
{"text": "Louis Ross redirects here. For those of similar name, see Lewis Ross (disambiguation) Louis Warren Ross (July 18, 1893 \u2013 September 8, 1966) was an American architect from Boston, Massachusetts, perhaps best known for his work at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he designed over thirty of the campus buildings there. Ross was born in Arlington, Massachusetts on July 18, 1893, the third of the five children of Louis Hall Ross and Mable Louisa Rawson. He was the grandson of agriculturalist Warren Winn Rawson and Helen Maria Mair. Graduating from Arlington High School in June 1913, he entered the Massachusetts Agricultural College (presently the University of Massachusetts Amherst) as a pomology major in the fall of that same year. During his time at the college he was notably active in college sports, having played on the football, baseball, and hockey teams, serving as captain of the latter. He was also a member of the campus \\\"mandolin club\\\" and the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Ross graduated in 1917, entering the army soon after. He would serve as an infantry lieutenant in the 166th Regiment of the 42nd Infantry Division, better known as the \\\"Rainbow Division\\\", in France during the First World War. By the end of the war he had been awarded a Purple Heart with an oak leaf cluster. After the war, Ross entered the Harvard Graduate School of Architecture in 1921, graduating four years later in 1925. He would spend the next ten years working as a draftsman for prominent Boston architect, Edward T. P. Graham before starting his own firm in 1935. One of his first independent projects, Thatcher House, was designed for his alma mater as the first dorm of the Northeast Residential Complex and the oldest dormitory still in use on campus today. His first design was seen as such a success by the university (by known this time known as Massachusetts State College) that he was given a gold medal at the 1938 commencement for his design and oversight of the building's construction. This would be the first of over 20 dormitories that he would design for the university, among other buildings. Although not as widely known as his campus work, Ross would also design a variety of buildings in the towns of Amherst, Northampton, Winchester, Needham and Newton. Ross moved to Newton in the early 1920s where he met Dorothy M. Pickett; the couple were wed on October 8, 1928. They had two children, a son, Warren R. Ross, and a daughter, Sally L. Pestalozzi. In the last 10 years of his life Ross spent his summers in Rockport, and continued his work up until the age of 72, only a year prior to his death. After what was described as \\\"a brief illness\\\", Louis Warren Ross died on Thursday, September 8, 1966. Although his namesake is confined to the Builder's Association plaques of the many university buildings, never before, or since, has the Amherst campus been shaped so thoroughly by any single individual as Ross had done in his 30 years of service to the institution. It may be said that entire sections of the campus, encompass his legacy.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Architect", "wiki_name": "Louis_W._Ross", "word_count": 527, "label": "Architect", "people": "Louis W.

It was Josephine Baker who encouraged Belew to work as a costume designer. While he made costumes for plays, musicals, operas, ballets, TV specials and TV series, Belew is particularly famous for the stage outfits he made for Elvis. He created the tight-fitting black leather outfit that Elvis wore in the 1968 NBC Comeback Special, and the bell-bottomed jumpsuit outfits with high Napoleonic collars, pointed sleeve cuffs, wide belts and capes, decorated with gems, metal and rhinestone studding, sequins and embroidery. Belew also designed the suit Elvis is wearing on the famous photo of President Nixon and him in the Oval Office, a velveteen outfit originally designed for Elvis to use in his Las Vegas shows. Of the collars, Belew has explained that they were inspired by Napoleon's wardrobe and that he chose them because they would frame and draw attention to Presley's face. In an interview Belew explained why most of the jumpsuits were white: The lighting [in Las Vegas] was still in its early stages. And we found that the color that worked the best was white. It allowed them to change the colors on him, where as black would absorb all the color. And it was hard to highlight him. And we experimented with blue which was one of his favorite colors. Red. But it just ended up that white was the best thing and, of course, you know, you want the star to be the person, you know, and not the wardrobe. During the 1970s Belew designed Elvis' offstage wardrobe, as well. Among the most famous of Belew's Elvis jumpsuits are the American Eagle (created for the 1973 Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite) and the Peacock (first worn at the Forum in Los Angeles in 1974, and later seen on the cover to the 1975 album Promised Land). In 2008 the Peacock suit was sold at an online auction for $300,000. This made it the most expensive piece of Elvis memorabilia sold at auction. The elaborate embroidery, which was getting a more prominent role on the jumpsuits in 1974\u20131977, was the work of Gene Doucette. In the 1970's, Bill Belew was in big demand. He was busy doing television shows and movies, so he would give Gene the blank suits and Gene would design them himself. Gene designed most of the suits from 1972 until Elvis' death. He designed the more elaborate suits such as the Aloha, Peacock, Sundial, Tiger, and American Eagle.

(In some episodes, an apple.) According to the Iron Chef storylines, Kobe was slated to be an Iron Chef in 1993, but was considered too young and immature. To fix this issue, he moved to Italy for about 4 years to train, becoming the fourth Iron Chef upon his arrival home. In reality, Kobe had little to do with the show before he moved to Italy (although he was aware of the show's existence), and was asked to be on Iron Chef near the end of the four years. Originally believing that he would be a challenger, Kobe found out that he was to be an Iron Chef mere days before his departure from Italy. Because of his quick turnaround from culinary apprentice to Iron Chef, Kobe is often considered to be a \\\"junior Iron Chef\\\", having little experience compared to the other Iron Chefs. Kobe, unlike his three fellow chefs, typically rises alone in Kitchen Stadium, many times accompanied by a group of violins. It was also to be noted that challenging chefs who were to face Kobe always had the fact explicitly mentioned during the challenger's bio, something that was rarely done with the other three Iron Chefs. Kobe, known as the \\\"Prince of Pasta\\\", is the only Iron Chef to have lost his opening battle - ironically with pasta as its theme. Out of concern for his apparent time mismanagement during the battle, in subsequent battles he ran to the theme ingredient stand in the opening seconds (compared to his opponents who simply walked) in order for him to gain precious seconds that could be used for cooking. His tenure as an Iron Chef saw him battling in 23 battles, with 15-7-1 record. He is also the only Iron Chef to lose a dessert battle, though he is one of three Iron Chefs to have never lost consecutive battles, nor did he lose against an Italian chef after his opening loss, going 7-0. After Iron Chef, Kobe opened his own restaurant, the Ristorante Massa, in the Ebisu suburb of Tokyo.

He was interested in psychosomatic medicine, eventually gaining a reputation as a highly regarded psychotherapist. In 1902 he became a professor of neuropathology at Bern. Dubois was influenced by the writings of German psychiatrist Johann Christian August Heinroth (1773\u20131843). Dubois is known for the introduction of \\\"persuasion therapy\\\", a process that employed a rational approach for treatment of neurotic disorders. Within this discipline, he developed a psychotherapeutic methodology that was a form of Socratic dialogue, using the doctor-patient relationship as a means to persuade the patient to change his/her behavior. He believed it was necessary to appeal to a patient's intellect and reason in order to eliminate negative and self-destructive habits. He also maintained it was necessary for the physician to convince the patient of the irrationality of his/her neurotic feelings and thought processes. Dubois was disdainful of hypnotic therapy. Dubois has been described as \\\"the first significant modern proponent\\\" of a rational therapy or cognitive therapy, and for some time in the early 20th century it had competed in popularity with Freudian psychoanalysis, especially in the USA, but is little known today. His best known written work was the 1904 Les psychon\u00e9vroses et leur traitement moral, being later translated into English as \\\"Psychic Treatment of Nervous Disorders (The Psychoneuroses and Their Moral Treatment)\\\". The preface of this book was written by his friend, neurologist Joseph Jules Dejerine (1849\u20131917). Another influential publication by Dubois was a \\\"mind over matter\\\" treatise titled De l'influence de l'esprit sur le corps.

{"text": "Joseph Quick (6 November 1809 Chelsea, London \u2013 30 March 1894 Clapham Park) was an English civil engineer who was closely involved in improvements to water supply in the great industrial cities of the nineteenth century. Both his father and his son (author of The Water Supply of the Metropolis. London and New York: 1880) were also waterworks engineers by the name Joseph Quick. On 28 March 1844, as engineer to the Southwark Waterworks, Quick was called to give evidence before the Health and Towns Commissioners of the British Parliament. Again after the 1848/49 outbreak of cholera in London, he was one of the advisors to the government to improve the London water supply infrastructure. One proposal was to have all intake of water from the Thames moved from the tidal Thames to up-river of Teddington Lock. The expert evidence heard by parliament led to the Metropolis Water Act (1852), as a result of which Quick was entrusted with the building of the new Hampton Waterworks, which he designed in an Italianate style. Even before work at Hampton was complete, contamination of the water supply of the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company, providing water to the borough of Southwark, Battersea, and other locations in the vicinity, led to the 1853 cholera outbreak. A further cholera outbreak in Soho in 1854 added to the urgency. Both outbreaks were famously studied by Dr John Snow. The company\u2019s new facilities up-river at Hampton (shared with two other water companies) only came into operation in 1855. By 1851 Quick was also consulting engineer to the Grand Junction Waterworks Company. As such he bore responsibility for the water tower constructed in 1857-58 on Campden Hill, of which there is a well-known contemporary print, although he himself was not the designer. In 1857, together with Alexander Fraser, he was granted a patent for \u201cimprovements in apparatus for regulating the drawing off and supply of water and other fluids\u201d. Quick\u2019s expertise as a waterworks engineer was such that together with his son he set up an international consultancy, and in the 1860s became involved in projects for the provision of modern water supplies in Amsterdam, Berlin, Saint Petersburg, Antwerp and Beirut. In St Petersburg the open filter method that proved highly successful in Amsterdam turned out to be entirely unsuitable to local climatic conditions.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Engineer", "wiki_name": "Joseph_Quick_(engineer)", "word_count": 387, "label": "Engineer", "people": "Joseph Quick"}

He worked as an engineering consultant for Alcott & Lomax, who would be acquired by Babtie in 2000. During his consulting career he was involved with the construction of water pumping stations. Rowntree was appointed director of the Water Resources Board (WRB), a national water planning body established in 1964. The WRB was dominated by civil engineers and focussed its efforts on implementing structural solutions to water resource problems. Rowntree was a keen proponent of that school of thought saying in 1962 that \\\"the solution of water supply problems \u2026 will require the construction and operation of large works and highly\u2010developed technical control\\\". Under Rowntree's leadership the WRB was able to undertake what was the largest scheme of water planning yet seen in England and Wales. Rowntree was made a Knight Bachelor in Elizabeth II's birthday honours on 13 June 1970. Rowntree gave the Institution of Electrical Engineers 1972 Graham Clark Lecture on \\\"Conservation and use of water resources\\\" and the same year wrote an article for the Proceedings of the Royal Society B entitled \\\"Water Resources Management in England and Wales\\\". By 1974 he had become a Professor and, on 2 December that year, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by City University London.

Keane began his professional career at Wolverhampton Wanderers, scoring twice on his first team debut aged 17. The following season he was the club's leading goalscorer and scored his first international goal for the Republic of Ireland.

After military service in World War I from 1914 to 1918, the still lifes Kanoldt painted show the influence of Derain and an adaptation of cubist ideas. By the early 1920s Kanoldt developed the manner for which he is best known, a magic realist rendering of potted plants, angular tins, fruit and mugs on tabletops. He also painted portraits in the same severe style, as well as geometrical landscapes. In 1925 he was made a professor at Breslau Academy, a post he held until 1931. During this time he came into conflict with the Bauhaus faction at the Academy, and he was increasingly at odds with the avant garde.

{"text": "Charles George Male (8 May 1910 \u2013 19 February 1998) was an English footballer. Born in West Ham, London, Male trialled with West Ham United before playing with non-league Clapton. He joined Arsenal as an amateur in November 1929, turning professional in May 1930 and made his debut in a 7-1 victory over Blackpool on 27 December 1930. Initially a left-winger or left-half, usually deputising for Bob John. Male's appearances were few and far between - three in 1930-31 (in which Arsenal won the First Division for the first time in their history) and nine in 1931-32, although he was a surprise choice at left half in the 1932 FA Cup final after Alex James was withdrawn because of injury and the side reshuffled as a result. Arsenal controversially lost 2-1 to Newcastle United, after Newcastle's equaliser had come after the ball had already gone behind for a goal kick. In 1932, with Arsenal's current right back Tom Parker ageing and his replacement, Leslie Compton, not looking entirely assured, Male was converted from left half to right back by Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman; Male would later recount how, before being told of the switch by Chapman, he entered his office fearing for his future at the club, but Chapman convinced him not only could he play at right back, but that he was the best right back in the country. Bolstered by Chapman's pep talk, Male slotted into the right back role easily, and he became a near ever-present for the next seven seasons; he was undisputed first-choice right back and played over 35 matches for every season in that period. During that time, Arsenal won the First Division four more times (1932-33, 1933-34, 1934-35 and 1937-38), as well as the FA Cup in 1935-36. Male's performances for club soon meant he was an international; he made his debut for England against Scotland on 14 November 1934 and went on to win nineteen caps for his country, captaining the team for six of them. By the end of the 1930s, Male was Arsenal captain, although injuries restricted his appearances in 1938-39. However, World War II intervened when Male was 29 and at the peak of his career; he played nearly 200 wartime matches for Arsenal, as well as serving in the Royal Air Force in Palestine. Upon the resumption of League football Male was 36, but still played 8 times in Arsenal's 1947-48 First Division-winning season, and thus became the first player in League history to play in six title-winning seasons. His last match for Arsenal was an 8-0 victory over Grimsby Town in May 1948. In all he played 318 matches for the Gunners, though he never scored a goal. After retiring from playing, Male became a coach at Arsenal, training the youth and reserve teams. He was later a scout, discovering, amongst others, Charlie George. He was still at the club to see it win its first Double in 1970-71, before retiring finally in 1975; he later emigrated to Canada to live with his son. Although at the time of his death in February 1998, at the age of 87, he was reported as being the last survivor of the Herbert Chapman era, Ray Bowden survived until September that year, and to a greater age (89).", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "SoccerPlayer", "wiki_name": "George_Male", "word_count": 548, "label": "Soccer Player", "people": "George Male"}

{"text": "Benjamin Franklin Butler (November 5, 1818 \u2013 January 11, 1893), known pejoratively as \\\"Beast\\\" Butler by some contemporaries, was an American lawyer, politician, soldier and businessman from Massachusetts. Born in New Hampshire and raised in Lowell, Massachusetts, Butler is best known as a political major general of the Union Army during the American Civil War, and for his leadership role in the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson. He was a colorful and often controversial figure on the national stage and in the Massachusetts political scene, where he served one term as Governor. Butler, a successful trial lawyer, served in the Massachusetts legislature as an antiwar Democrat and as an officer in the state militia. Early in the Civil War he joined the Union Army, where he was noted for his lack of military skill, and his controversial command of New Orleans, which brought him wide dislike in the South and the \\\"Beast\\\" epithet. He helped create the legal idea of effectively freeing fugitive slaves by designating them as contraband of war in service of military objectives, which led to a political groundswell in the North which included general emancipation and the end of slavery as official war goals. His commands were marred by financial and logistical dealings across enemy lines, some of which probably took place with his knowledge and to his financial benefit. Butler was dismissed from the Union Army after his failures in the First Battle of Fort Fisher, but soon won election to the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts. As a Radical Republican he opposed President Johnson's Reconstruction agenda, and was the House's lead manager in the Johnson impeachment proceedings. As Chairman of the House Committee on Reconstruction, Butler authored the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 and coauthored the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1875. In Massachusetts, Butler was often at odds with more conservative members of the political establishment over matters of both style and substance. Feuds with Republican politicians led to his being denied several nominations for the governorship between 1858 and 1880. Returning to the Democratic fold, he won the governship in the 1882 election with Democratic and Greenback Party support. He ran for President on the Greenback ticket in 1884.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Politician", "l3": "Congressman", "wiki_name": "Benjamin_Butler_(politician)", "word_count": 370, "label": "Congressman", "people": "Benjamin Butler"}
{"text": "Eugene de Salignac (1861\u20131943) was an American photographer who worked for the Department of Bridges/Plant and Structures in New York City. Born in Boston in 1861 into an eccentric family of exiled French nobility, de Salignac had no formal training in photography. In 1903, at the age of 42, his brother-in-law found him a job as an assistant to the photographer for the Department of Bridges, Joseph Palmer. After 3 years of apprenticeship, Palmer suddenly died, and in October 1906, de Salignac assumed his duties. As the sole photographer for the department from 1906 to 1934 (in 1916 it changed its name to the Department of Plant & Structures), he documented the creation of the city's modern infrastructure\u2014including bridges, major municipal buildings, roads and subways. Most notably, he documented the construction of the Manhattan Bridge and the Queensboro Bridge, and the Manhattan Municipal Building but his most famous image is that of painters posing nonchalantly on the cables of the Brooklyn Bridge. Using a large-format camera and 8x10 inch glass-plate negatives, he shot over 20,000 images in his career. Most of these negatives and over 15,000 vintage prints are held by the New York City Municipal Archives. Into his 70s de Salignac was still climbing bridges and actively working, but he was forced to retire in 1934 despite a petition to Mayor La Guardia. In his lifetime de Salignac's work was little seen outside of New York City government, and his name was forgotten after his death in 1943. His images were rediscovered in the 1980s, but it was not until 1999 that an archivist realized the collection was mostly the work of one man. In 2007, Aperture published New York Rises, the first monograph of his work, which became a traveling exhibition that opened at the Museum of the City of New York. Since then, his photographs have been widely reproduced and are part of a growing interest in industrial photography that has been left out of the traditional photography canon.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Photographer", "wiki_name": "Eugene_de_Salignac", "word_count": 332, "label": "Photographer", "people": "Eugene de Salignac"}
{"text": "In the 1934 Tour de France, Vietto, a relative unknown, got wings on the mountains. This was not a surprise, because he had won the Grand Prix Wolber. He was prepared for the Alps and won easily on the steepest terrain. After he won the two major Alpine stages, journalists reported that this 'boy' could be the purest mountain climber that France knew. During the 1934 Tour, he was poised to be race leader after his team leader Antonin Magne crashed during stage 16. Vietto was unaware of Magne's situation; his advantage gave him the virtual race lead. A marshal on a motorcycle caught Vietto to inform him his captain was on the side of the road, with team-mate Lap\u00e9bie ahead, and the other team-mates behind the yellow jersey. Vietto turned and rode back up the mountain into the descending riders (at the time, reversing course was legal, but is no longer so), to give Magne his bike. Magne mounted Vietto's bike and with Lap\u00e9bie closed the gap to preserve his overall lead and win the Tour. A photograph shows Vietto sitting on a stone wall as the race passes. This made him a star in France. The image of a 20-year-old who sacrificed his chance of winning the Tour doubled his popularity. Vietto was nevertheless named the Tour's best climber; he finished 5th overall, almost 1 hour behind Magne. Vietto never won the Tour. He was closest in 1939, when he gained the yellow jersey in Lorient in one of the first stages, but in the mountains, once his favorite place, he was left by Sylv\u00e8re Maes. After that Tour, war broke out and the race wasn't held until 1947. Vietto, still loved, attacked from the second stage. As a result, he took the yellow jersey in Brussels, to lose it a day before the finish, in a time trial of 139 km. Despite failing to hold the lead, Vietto wore the yellow jersey for 15 stages during the 1938 Tour de France and during the 1947 Tour de France for 14 stages. He finished second in 1939, fifth in 1934 and 1947 and eighth in 1935. Until Fabian Cancellara broke his record in the 2012 Tour de France, Vietto had the highest career yellow jersey statistics of anyone to never win the Tour de France overall. Vietto lost a toe to sepsis in 1947. Legend has it that Vietto insisted his domestique, Apo Lazarides, cut off one of his own toes to match.

{"text": "Peter Alfred Penfold, CMG, OBE, (born 27 February 1944) is a retired British diplomat. His career began in 1963, when he joined the Foreign Service as a clerical officer. Two years into his career, he was posted to the British embassy in Bonn, West Germany, and two years after that to Nigeria. From 1970 to 1972, Penfold served as a \\\"floater\\\" in Latin America, filling in as necessary for staff at British missions in the region. He served in Mexico during the 1970 football world cup, and on St Vincent, where he was responsible for organising an evacuation after a volcanic eruption. After Latin America, Penfold briefly served in Canberra, before returning to London to take a post in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). He earned early promotion to second secretary in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he was responsible for reporting on the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Eritrean War of Independence and was still in the country during the revolution, in which the pro-Western emperor was overthrown. After completing his tour in Ethiopia, Penfold served as information officer in Port of Spain and then as first secretary in the West Africa Department of the FCO. Penfold's next overseas posting was to Kampala, Uganda, as deputy high commissioner. There, he persuaded President Milton Obote to attend the queen's birthday party for the first time. Two months later, Obote was overthrown in a coup, after which Penfold led an evacuation of foreign citizens to Kenya. The high commission remained open, and Penfold was still present six months later when a second coup took place. In 1987, he again returned to the FCO, this time serving in the West Indian and Atlantic Department, and four years later, he was appointed Governor of the British Virgin Islands. The main issues of Penfold's tenure were the establishment of the territory as an offshore financial centre and the smuggling of drugs through its waters until the sudden death of the chief minister. Penfold resolved the subsequent constitutional crisis by appointing the deputy chief minister as an interim replacement. Penfold's term as governor expired in 1996, after which he spent a year as a drugs adviser to the Caribbean before being appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone in 1997. Six weeks into Penfold's term, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was overthrown in a military coup and Penfold organised an evacuation of foreign citizens. After a hotel housing the remaining foreign nationals was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which was conducted by an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees\u2014including Penfold\u2014to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but the role of the private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in Sierra Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in Sierra Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent the last year of his career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has been critical of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role in returning him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status in Sierra Leone.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Ambassador", "wiki_name": "Peter_Penfold", "word_count": 631, "label": "Ambassador", "people": "Peter Penfold"}

The Modena Autodrome was situated near Via Emilia, which crosses the city of Modena. Cabianca was testing a Cooper-Ferrari F1 car, owned by Scuderia Castellotti, when he suffered a suspected stuck throttle. Unable to stop, his Cooper went off track, struck a spectator and then went through the gate of the Autodrome which was open because of men at work near the track. The car crossed the Via Emilia and crashed against the wall of a workshop. Crossing the road, Cabianca's Cooper struck a bicycle, a motorcycle, and a small mini-van (not a taxi as often reported) and three parked cars. The driver of the mini-van (also called \\\"giardinetta\\\" following a famous van of Fiat) and the motorcycle driver were killed at the scene. The biker was crushed and killed instantly by a heavy block of iron carried on the mini-van. Cabianca was conscious, but died a few hours later at the hospital. The spectator hit just after the car left the track suffered severe leg injuries, but survived.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "RacingDriver", "l3": "FormulaOneRacer", "wiki_name": "Giulio_Cabianca", "word_count": 247, "label": "Formula One Racer", "people": "Giulio Cabianca"}

Lazzaro, irritated by the success of some of his contemporaries, prompted him to the commission the poisoning of Giacomo Bargone; and he hired persons to vilify the works of the ablest painters of the time, and to extol his own. While engaged in these schemes, he was engaged to paint the Birth and Life of St. John the Baptist, together with Andrea Semini and Luca Cambiaso, for the chapel of the Nobili Centurioni. Lazzaro was so mortified at this challenge, that he became a mariner, and withdrew himself from painting for twenty years. He returned, however, to his profession, which he continued till he was in his 85th year. His last works were for the church of Santa Cattaprina. Pantaleone's sons: Aurelio, Marcantonio, Benedetto, and Felice; also became painters. Of these, Marcantonio Calvi was the most distinguished painting with his brothers decorations in palazzo Doria, and by himself in Pegli, San Pietro d'Ancona, and other palaces of Liguria, including the loggia degli Spinola.

He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency. Armstrong's second and last spaceflight was as commander of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969.

He played primarily shortstop for five different teams spanning 15 seasons. He made his major league debut for Altoona Mountain City of the Union Association in 1884. After Altoona's team folded after just 25 games, he jumped to the Cleveland Blues of the National League. After the 1884 season, Cleveland then sold him, along with 6 other players, to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms for $4000. On June 17, 1885, Germany reportedly committed seven errors intentionally, when his team decided to punish new pitcher, Phenomenal Smith, losing the game 18-5. All 18 runs against the brash left-hander were unearned\u201a due to a total of 14 Brooklyn \\\"errors\\\". \\\"Phenomenal\\\" gave himself his nickname before he joined the team\u201a saying that he was so good that he didn't need his teammates to win. The intentional misplays of his teammates caused club President Lynch to fine the guilty players $500 each\u201a but he reluctantly agrees to release Smith to ensure team harmony. A reliable shortstop in the days when a fielding average below .900 could lead the league, he did, in fact, lead the American Association in 1887, with an .886 average. When the AA folded in 1890, he, along with most members of the team transferred to the National League's new Brooklyn franchise. In 1891 John Montgomery Ward took over as manager and shortstop, effectively ending Smith's career with Brooklyn, so he left and joined the Cincinnati Reds. There he led NL shortstops in assists each year from 1891 to 1894. Smith later returned in 1897, when Cincinnati and Brooklyn swapped shortstops, with Tommy Corcoran moving to the Reds. His major league career came to end after the 1898 season, when he played just 51 games for the St. Louis Browns, and moved on to play for the Minneapolis Millers of the Northwestern League for the 1899 and 1900 seasons.

{"text": "Robert Vorhoelzer (born 13 June 1884 Memmingen - died 23 October 1954 Munich) was a German architect. Bavarian architect Robert Vorhoelzer belongs to the classical modernist school of architecture that is otherwise rather underrepresented in Bavaria. Most of his works were built when Vorhoelzer was Oberbaurat of the Bavarian postal administration. Together with Robert Poeverlein he founded the \\\"Bayerische Postbauschule\\\". In the early stages of his work, such as at the post office Penzberg or the post office on Ismaninger Stra\u00dfe in Munich, the influence of the \\\"Heimatstil\\\" was dominant. But later Vorhoelzer built many modern and functional buildings (post offices, depots, apartment buildings for postal staff etc.) in the style of Neue Sachlichkeit. These include, for example, the post office on Tegernseer Landstra\u00dfe ( \\\"Tela-Post\\\") in Munich-Obergiesing, the post office building at Goethe Platz or the post office at Harras place in Munich-Sendling (1931\u201332), a white office building with a rotunda and high rise apartment blocks in the background. The harmonious integration of his buildings in the surrounding urban landscape proves Vorhoelzer's ability as a city planner. In particular, the appearance of the Arnulfstra\u00dfe in Munich owns much to the numerous Vorhoelzer buildings. In 1930, Robert Vorhoelzer has been appointed professor at the Technical University of Munich. With the beginning of the Third Reich he lost his chair accused of being an \\\"architectural bolshevist\\\", although he resumed working as an architect and, for example, built the church \\\"Mary Queen of Peace\\\" in Obergiesing (1936\u201337). On the eve of WWII, Vorhoelzer emigrated to Turkey, from where he has been expelled in 1941 due to an allegation of espionage for Germany. After the war, he retrieved his chair, but in 1947 he has been suspended again for six months after Nazi allegations concerning the date of the Turkish exile. In the post-war debate on the reconstruction of Munich, Vorhoelzer pointed out that parts of the city had been in need of rehabilitation even before the war. He called for a radical new development plan, in which Flachbauten low-rise and high-rise buildings played an important part. He also had been ahead of his times in his request to discuss the reconstruction in public. In 1952, Vorhoelzer retired and two years later, he died at the age of 70 years after an operation. His last major work was the monumental parish church of St. Joseph in Dingolfing, which had only been completed 1954 to 1956 after his death. For this hall-type church, he applied motives that were already present in the church Giesinger \\\"Mary Queen of Peace\\\".", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Architect", "wiki_name": "Robert_Vorhoelzer", "word_count": 424, "label": "Architect", "people": "Robert Vorhoelzer"}

Louis Kahn's works are considered as monumental beyond modernism. Famous for his meticulously built works, his provocative proposals that remained unbuilt, and his teaching, Kahn was one of the most influential architects of the twentieth century.

{"text": "Lois Anna Barker (born April 7, 1923) is a former utility player who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the 1950 season. Listed at 5 ft 3 in (1.60 m), 130 lb, she batted and threw right-handed. Born in Dover, New Jersey, Barker was one of seven girls in a nine-sibling family. While growing up in Chester Borough, she used to watch her father coach baseball teams and her brother's career as an Olympic track athlete. In an interview, Barker recalled catching batting practice for a local men's team when she was eight years old. She admitted to growing up \\\"more boy than girl\\\". The reason, she explained matter-of-factly, stems from the nickname she received as an infant \u2013 Tommie. In fact, her family thought she would be a boy and had a name all picked out, Thomas Henry. As she told the story, her brothers and sisters, when passing her crib, would exclaim, \\\"There's our Tommie!\\\", and the name stuck. Barker graduated from Roxbury High School, where she played softball, and started to play in organized leagues and tournaments in 1947 with the Chester Farmerettes, being able to play all positions except catcher. In one game, she turned an unassisted triple play while playing at shortstop. After making the league at tryouts held in Irvington, she signed a contract and went to the AAGPBL rookie camp in South Bend, Indiana. Barker entered the league in 1950 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, being used primarily in the outfield and at third base. Making the AAGPBL at age 27 as a rookie, was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. Grand Rapids, managed by Johnny Rawlings, took fourth place with a 59\u201353 record and advanced to the postseason, but lost in the first round of the best-of-five series to the Fort Wayne Daisies. Baker was a .125 hitter in 32 games and received a contract for the 1951 season, but she was unable to play due to family commitments. Following her baseball career, Barker took a job in a company connected with the aerospace industry, working at all the way from entry level to supervisor during 40 years, until her retirement in 1990. She also played softball for about ten years after she obtained permission to play amateur sports again. Asked about her most exciting memories while playing in the AAGPBL, Barker explained that it was A childhood dream being fulfilled and really coming true; To be a part of something really neat and to be part of the war effort in some small way; Being paid for playing the game you loved to play; Many friendships that are very special even today, and making the playoffs after losing the first 20 games. She also describes the first AAGPBL game in which she played, a night game no less, when she felt pretty nervous\u2026lost a fly ball in the lights and it hit me on the head! She claimed not feeling badly about that now, especially after seeing Jos\u00e9 Canseco lost a fly ball (hit by Carlos Mart\u00ednez) that bounced off Canseco's head and over the wall for a home run. It was a few years ago (1993), she added. At the time that it happened to her, though, all she wanted to do was catch the next train back to New Jersey. Barker is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than any individual personality. She also was honored by the Chester Historical Society in 1999, during the Chester Township's Bicentennial Parade celebration. After retirement, Barker focused much of her time and energy visiting friends and family and traveling to reunions of the AAGPBL Players Association.

He debuted on April 17, 1923 and played his final game on September 30, 1928. In 1925, he had a .364 on-base percentage and 55 runs batted in and was 18th in the voting for the National League's Most Valuable Player Award. Over six season, he played in 848 games, including 772 at shortstop. For his career, he hit for a .258 average with a .343 on-base percentage. Born in San Francisco, California, Sand got his start playing for the Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League from 1918 to 1922. Sand had an unassisted triple play while playing for Salt Lake City. Sand is best known for his role in a 1924 bribery incident that resulted in two players being banned from baseball by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Sand knew New York Giants player Jimmy O'Connell from their days in San Francisco. On September 23, the Phillies were out of contention, and O'Connell offered to pay $500 to Sand if he would \\\"go easy\\\" on the Giants. The incident came to the attention of Judge Landis, who conducted a hearing. O'Connell admitted making the offer and implicated Giants coach Cozy Dolan in the scheme. Landis banned both O'Connell and Dolan from baseball. Sand was involved as a shortstop in three triple plays in his career. In July 1924, Sand was involved in a triple play on a ball hit by Heinie Groh. In 1929, Sand was acquired by the Rochester Red Wings of the International League.

{"text": "Lazaro Sosa Barrera (May 8, 1924 \u2013 April 25, 1991) was a Cuban-born American Hall of Fame thoroughbred racehorse trainer. Born in Havana, \\\"Laz\\\" Barrera was one of nine brothers who went on to become involved in thoroughbred horse racing in the United States. While in his teens, he began working at a racetrack in his native Cuba and within a few years was one of the country's most respected young trainers. Seeking increased opportunities in a larger market, in the 1940s Barrera moved to Mexico to race horses at the Hipodromo de las Americas in Mexico City. There, he met California-based trainer Hal King, who encouraged him to come to the United States. Barrera did, and in 1971 trained his first American Stakes race winner. In the ensuing years he built a solid reputation and in late 1975 was given Bold Forbes to train who had been that year's Puerto Rican two-year-old thoroughbred sprint champion. Racing in the U.S. in 1976 under jockey Angel Cordero, Jr., Bold Forbes won several important races for Barrera including the Wood Memorial Stakes in record time. He went on to win the most prestigious race of all, the Kentucky Derby, finished third in the Preakness Stakes and, for a converted sprinter, pulled off a dramatic win in the 1\u00bd mile long Belmont Stakes. Barrera's accomplishments led to an offer from Louis & Patrice Wolfson to take over as head trainer for their Harbor View Farm in Ocala, Marion County, Florida. There, Barrera took charge of a horse named Affirmed who, under 18-year-old jockey Steve Cauthen, would become one of the great horses in American racing history. Affirmed was a two-time Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner and won Eclipse Awards in each of the three years he raced. Laz Barrera won fourteen Grade 1 Stakes races with Affirmed, the most by any stallion in history, and earned racing immortality by capturing the 1978 U.S. Triple Crown, the tenth trainer to sweep the races in a season. Since then, one trainer (D. Wayne Lukas) has won all three of the Triple Crown races, in 1995 when he trained two horses (Thunder Gulch and Timber Country) for the only individual Triple Crown winner, but it would not be until 20 years after Lukas' unique double that Bob Baffert would do the traditional Crown with American Pharoah doing the triple in 2015. In a career that lasted almost fifty years, Laz Barrera trained six champions and more than 140 American Stakes race winners. He was the leading money-winning trainer from 1977 to 1980 and in the process became the only trainer to ever win four consecutive Eclipse Awards. In 1979, he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Laz Barrera died in 1991; the Lazaro Barrera Memorial Stakes a Grade II seven furlong race for 3-year-olds at Hollywood Park Racetrack is named in his honor.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "HorseTrainer", "wiki_name": "Laz_Barrera", "word_count": 486, "label": "Horse Trainer", "people": "Laz Barrera"}

Left the school for girls \u2116156 in Moscow with a gold medal, 1951. Graduated from Moscow Aviation Institute, 1957, and Zhukovsky-Academy, Monino, 1967. In December 1961, the selection of female cosmonauts was authorised by the Soviet Government, with the specific intention of ensuring the first woman in space was a Soviet citizen. In February 1962 Ponomaryova was selected in a group of five female cosmonauts to be trained for a Vostok flight. The group spent several months in intensive training, concluding with examinations in November 1962, after which the four remaining candidates were commissioned Junior Lieutenants in the Soviet Air Force. Ponomaryova established herself one of the leading candidates with Valentina Tereshkova and Irina Solovyova, and a joint mission profile was developed that would see two women launched into space, on solo Vostok flights on consecutive days. The honour of being the first woman in space was to be given to Valentina Tereshkova who would launch first on Vostok 5 while Ponomaryova would follow her into orbit on Vostok 6. However Ponomaryova did not respond with standard Soviet cliches in interviews and her feminism made the Soviet leadership uneasy, and this led to the flight profile being altered in March 1963. Vostok 5 would now carry a male, cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky, flying the joint mission with Tereshkova aboard Vostok 6 in June 1963. Tereshkova's backup was Irina Solovyova, with Ponomaryova in a supporting 'second back-up' role. Despite this setback, Ponomaryova remained with the program until 1969. She was at one stage slated to fly on a circumlunar Soyuz flight in 1965 before substantial delays in the Soyuz spacecraft led to the cancellation of this flight. She was also to lead an all-female crew on a ten-day mission aboard Voskhod 5 but the program was cancelled before she had a chance to fly. Ponomaryova retired in 1969 when it became clear that there were no plans for a female Soyuz flight. Ponomaryova later worked in orbital mechanics at the Gagarin Training Center. Following this, she was a research scientist at the Institute of Natural Historic Sciences. She was awarded a Candidate of Technical Sciences degree in 1974. She married fellow cosmonaut Yuri Ponomaryov in 1972 and the couple had two children before divorcing.

{"text": "George Hatfeild Dingley Gossip (December 6, 1841 \u2013 May 11, 1907) was a minor American-English chess master and writer. He competed in chess tournaments between 1870 and 1895, playing against most of the world's leading players, but with only modest success. The writer G. H. Diggle calls him \\\"the King of Wooden Spoonists\\\" because he usually finished last in strong tournaments.Gossip was also a noted writer. His treatise The Chess-Player's Manual\u2014A Complete Guide to Chess, a 900-page tome published in 1874 after several years of work, was harshly received by the critics, largely because he had included a number of informal skittles games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Chess Champion, wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess-Player's Manual was one of the best available books on the game. Thanks in part to a 122-page appendix by S. Lipsch\u00fctz, it became one of the standard opening works of the time. Gossip made his living primarily as a journalist, author, and translator. He wrote for publications in England, France, Australia, and the United States. At various times he resided in each of those countries, as well as in Germany and Canada. In 1898 and 1899, two publishers issued Gossip's sole book about a subject other than chess, The Jew of Chamant. Published under the pseudonym \\\"Ivan Trepoff\\\", it was virulently antisemitic. Chess writers have often mocked Gossip's play, calling him a \\\"grandpatzer\\\" and the like. However, Kenneth Whyld, one of his previous critics, suggests that history may have judged him unfairly.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "ChessPlayer", "wiki_name": "George_H._D._Gossip", "word_count": 289, "label": "Chess Player", "people": "George H.

{"text": "Veronica Josephine Lenard (September 2, 1921 \u2013 February 7, 2007) was a center fielder who played from 1944 through 1953 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5' 4\\\", 130 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. A native of Chicago, Illinois, Jo Lenard grew up playing baseball with her brother and the other boys in the streets of her neighborhood. Playground ball was the next step, then into the high school league and on to a Chicago amateur girls softball team. Lenard was in school when she learned that there was a nationwide effort to recruit women to play in a new Midwest professional softball/baseball league. By the fall of 1942, many Minor league teams disbanded due to World War II conflict, when young ballplayers were being drafted into the armed services. The fear that this pattern would continue prompted Philip K. Wrigley, a chewing gum magnate and owner of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball team, to search for a possible solution to this dilemma. When President Roosevelt gave the order to continue baseball for the morale of the nation, Wrigley decided that it was time to do it. With the dedication of a group of Midwestern businessmen, and the financial support of Wrigley, the new league emerged in the spring of 1943. Lenard attended a AAGPBL tryout and made the grade, starting a professional career that spanned ten years. A consistent line-drive hitter who used the entire field and excelled at slap bunting for base hits, she was a skillful contact hitter with a near perfect eye for the strike zone and seldom struck out. By the time her AAGPBL career ended in 1953, Lenard had driven in 351 runs to place her ninth on the career RBI list for the league, despite hitting only one home run in just over 3400 at bats. She also collected 520 stolen bases and walked 481 times against only 234 strikeouts for a 2.06 BB/K ratio. A natural center fielder, she possessed a strong and accurate throwing arm. Lenard entered the league in 1944 with the Rockford Peaches, playing for them two years before joining the Muskegon Lassies (1946-'49), Peoria Redwings (1949), Kenosha Comets (1950-'51) and South Bend Blue Sox (1952-'53). In her rookie season, she hit a .211 average and stole 68 bases, while leading the circuit with 10 triples. Her most productive season came in 1947, when she hit a career-high .261 with 38 RBI in 111 games and was selected for the All-Star team. She also made four trips to the playoffs with four different teams, including for the championship winners in 1945 and 1952. Following her professional baseball career, Lenard went back to school and graduated from Chicago Teachers College, and then taught health and physical education for 25 years. Besides becoming an educator and coach, she was a strong advocate for the advancement of girls and women in sports. In 1968 she was assaulted and hit in the head, suffering eye damage that left her nearly blind. Lenard is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, opened in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual player.

He was a good climber, with an aggressive style, making cycling a spectacle, which gained him fans. On one hand, there were days when he was extremely successful attacking. On the other, he occasionally suffered from big losses of time due to mistakes or strokes of bad luck. He was also a good time-trialist until the nineties, when it became difficult for him to adapt to technical changes in the time-trial bicycles. The ending of the 1987 Tour de France and the 1985 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and the whole 1989 Tour are among his more memorable participations in major competitions. Delgado tested positive for the known masking agent, probenecid, during the 1988 tour, was allowed to continue racing and was not charged with any doping offence.

He is also described as having a nature that only wished to please the ladies. In search of employment, he left Rome to travel to Naples, and spent some years employed in Piedemonte de Liso. Upon returning to Rome, he was accused of attempting to sell forgeries he had painted in the style of grand masters.

Among his works are a Pieta and Prophets in the ceiling of a chapel to the right of the entrance of Santa Maria in Vallicella.

{"text": "Robert Smythson (1535\u20131614) was an English architect. Smythson designed a number of notable houses during the Elizabethan era. Little is known about his birth and upbringing\u2014his first mention in historical records comes in 1556, when he was stonemason for the house at Longleat, built by Sir John Thynne (ca. 1512-1580). He later designed Hardwick Hall, Wollaton Hall, Burton Agnes Hall, and other significant projects. Historically, a number of other Elizabethan houses, such as Gawthorpe Hall have been attributed to him on stylistic grounds. In Britain at this time, the profession of architect was in its most embryonic stage of development. Smythson was trained as a stonemason, and by the 1560s was travelling England as a master mason leading his own team of masons. In 1568 he moved from London to Wiltshire to commence work on the new house at Longleat for Sir John Thynne; he worked there for almost eighteen years, carving personally much of the external detail, and he is believed to have had a strong influence on the overall design of the building. In 1580 he moved to his next project\u2014Wollaton Hall. At Wollaton he was clearly more a \\\"surveyor\\\" (the term at that time for an architect) than a stonemason, and was in charge of overall construction. Smythson's style was more than a fusion of influences; although Renaissance, especially Sebastiano Serlio, Flemish and English Gothic notes can be seen in his work, he produced some ingenious adaptations, resulting in classically detailed, innovative domestic buildings. Hardwick in particular is noted for its use of glass. Smythson died at Wollaton in 1614 and is buried in the parish church there; his memorial includes these words \\\"Architecter (sic) and Surveyor unto the most worthy house of Wollaton with divers others of great account.\\\" His son John Smythson (Bolsover Castle) and grandson Huntingdon Smithson (as he spelt the family name) were also architects.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Architect", "wiki_name": "Robert_Smythson", "word_count": 312, "label": "Architect", "people": "Robert Smythson"}

In 1976, he went temporarily back to \u0130zmir, Turkey for military service. Since 1972 he has been living in Austria and has been an Austrian citizen since 1994. Recently, he is working for a telecommunication company in Vienna. During the sixteenth ICCF World Championship, he had amassed an unassailable 11 points out of 15 games with one game remaining. Hamarat was deadly on the black side of the Sicilian Sveshnikov, beating former CC World Champion Horst Rittner of Germany and Greek International Master Spyros Kofidis with it. At one time, Hamarat was supposed not to have lost a single game as White in over 40 years. However, this retroactively ceased to be the case, as correspondence chess games date from their year of initiation, and Hamarat eventually lost games playing with the white pieces against Edgar Prang (started in 2001) and Hans Marcus Elwert (started in 2002), though he apparently resigned these only after he became World Champion in January 2004. In 'over-the-board' chess, he played in the finals of the Turkish championships three times. In Vienna, he played in the top league. But since 1963 his main interest has been correspondence chess, \\\"because I am a perfectionist\\\", he says. In 1997, he earned the title of International Grandmaster of Correspondence Chess. Hamarat also plays backgammon professionally. He is the top player in Austria. He won several titles in international backgammon tournaments. Besides, he is also an expert in jazz music, and acts as a jazz DJ in Vienna. The Austrian mail authority issued a personified postage stamp with his picture in his honor. The Wiener Zeitung, an important newspaper, named him as the 'Viennese of the month'.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "ChessPlayer", "wiki_name": "Tun\u00e7_Hamarat", "word_count": 352, "label": "Chess Player", "people": "Tun\u00e7 Hamarat"}

{"text": "Alexander Siemens (22 January 1847 \u2013 16 February 1928) was a German electrical engineer. Siemens was born in Hanover, then a kingdom within the German Confederation, to Gustav and Sophie Siemens of the Siemens family, an old family of Goslar which can be traced back to 1384. His father was a judge and a cousin of William Siemens the famous electrical engineer. He was educated in Hanover and moved to Woolwich, London in 1867 to work with at the Siemens Brothers factory. He returned to the German Confederation in 1868 to study at the University of Berlin, interrupting his studies there to lay telegraph cables in the Middle East. These cables were to form part of the Indo-European Telegraph and much of the work was undertaken by Siemens Brothers. Upon the annexation of Hanover by Prussia in 1866 following the Austro-Prussian War Siemens became a Prussian citizen and liable to conscription. He was conscripted in 1870 as a private to fight in the Franco-Prussian War where he was wounded at the Battle of Beaune-la-Rolande. It was for his actions in this battle where Prussian forces won a decisive victory over the numerically superior French army that he was awarded the Iron Cross. After demobilization in 1871 he returned to the family business in Woolwich and assisted with the building of furnaces for use in steel foundries and crematoria. In 1871 Siemens was a founder member of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians (which became the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1889) and was president of the institution twice, in 1894 and in 1904. His first inaugural address was an analysis of the Electric Lighting Acts of 1882 and 1888, his second advocating a wider use of the metric system. In 1875 he sailed aboard the cable ship Faraday, laying several cables across the North Atlantic. In between voyages he built several furnaces for companies in the USA and Canada. Returning to the UK in 1877 he became a British citizen through naturalization in 1878. He was appointed the manager of the electric lighting division of Siemens Brothers in 1879 and was involved in the manufacture of generators, arc lamps and cables for the electric industry. In 1881 he married Louisa Dodwell with whom he would have three daughters. Later that year Siemens Brothers took over a project to provide the world\u2019s first public electricity supply in Godalming, Surrey. This project was never a viable business but the company undertook it in order to gain more experience in the lighting industry. Siemens had been a director of Siemens Brothers since it became a limited company in 1880 and was made managing director in 1889, a post he was to hold until a significant reorganization replaced him, though he remained on the board of directors until his retirement in 1918. He was appointed to be a British delegate to the International Electrical Congress in 1893 and to a similar congress in Paris in 1901. In the same year as the Paris congress he was appointed to the board of the new National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. He served as President of the Institution of Civil Engineers between November 1910 and November 1911. In retirement he lived at Westover Hall, Milford-on-Sea, Hampshire, where he died, from heart failure, on 16 February 1928.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Engineer", "wiki_name": "Alexander_Siemens", "word_count": 550, "label": "Engineer", "people": "Alexander Siemens"}

Ross began his career in railway engineering with the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) before moving to the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1871. In 1873 he went to work for the North Eastern Railway (NER) before returning to LNWR in the next year. He changed employer again in 1884 when he went to work for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) before becoming the Chief Engineer of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR) in 1890. During his time at MS&LR he was responsible for the design of many of the works involved with that company's London Extension. In 1896 Ross became the Chief Engineer of the Great Northern Railway (GNR), a post he held until 1911 when he became an engineering consultant. During his time at GNR his advice was sought by the company's board on the locomotive design to be chosen for their no.1300 series of engines. Several designs were rejected as they were judged to be too long or heavy for the rail infrastructure. Despite several attempts at redesign by Nigel Gresley the series was scrapped in 1924. His works as an engineering consultant included the Hertford Loop Line and Breydon Viaduct, with Ross serving as the Engineer-in-Chief of the latter. On 16 June 1897 he was appointed Major in the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, an unpaid unit of the Volunteer Force which provided technical advice to the British Army. He was a Lieutenant-Colonel in that corps at the time it joined the Territorial Force on 1 April 1908.

{"text": "Sir Percy Cradock GCMG PC (26 October 1923 \u2013 22 January 2010) was a British diplomat, civil servant and sinologist who served as British Ambassador to the People's Republic of China from 1978 to 1983, playing a significant role in the Sino-British negotiations which led up to the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984. Joining the Foreign Office in 1954, Cradock served primarily in Asia and was posted to the British charge d'affaires office in Peking (now Beijing) at the outset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. He, along with other British subjects, was manhandled by the Red Guards and the mobs when the office was set on fire on 22 August 1967. After the rioting, Cradock served as charge d'affaires in Peking from 1968 to 1969, and later succeeded Sir Edward Youde as British Ambassador to the People's Republic of China in 1978. His ambassadorship witnessed the start of the Sino-British negotiations in 1982, which subsequently resulted in the Joint Declaration in 1984, an agreement deciding the future of the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. However, the decision of Cradock, who was the British chief negotiator in the negotiations, to compromise with the Chinese authorities, was regarded as a major retreat by the general media in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, and was heavily criticised at that time as betraying the people of Hong Kong. Cradock remained a trusted advisor to the-then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who appointed him as Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee in 1985. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he was the first senior British official to pay a visit to the Chinese leadership in the hope of maintaining the much criticised Joint Declaration. He was successful in fighting to guarantee, in the Basic Law of Hong Kong, that half of the seats of the Legislative Council would be directly elected by 2007. However, Cradock worsened his relationship with Thatcher's successor, John Major, by forcing him to visit China in 1991 after the row between the two countries over the Airport Core Programme of Hong Kong. Major had enough of the compromising attitude of Cradock and the-then Governor of Hong Kong, Sir David Wilson, and finally decided to have both of them replaced in 1992, choosing instead his Conservative-ally Chris Patten as Governor. Unlike his predecessors, Patten was strongly criticised by the Chinese authorities during his governorship because he introduced a series of democratic reforms without consulting them. Although Cradock had retired, he joined the pro-Beijing camp, and became one of the most prominent critics of Governor Patten, censuring him for wrecking the hand-over agreement that had been agreed with the Chinese government. Cradock and Patten blamed each other publicly a number of times in the final years of British administration of Hong Kong. He once famously denounced Patten as an \\\"incredible shrinking Governor\\\", while Patten mocked him openly, in another occasion, as a \\\"dyspeptic retired ambassador\\\" suffering from \\\"Craddockitis\\\". Cradock spent his later years in writing a number of books on realpolitik diplomacy and was a non-executive director of the South China Morning Post.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Ambassador", "wiki_name": "Percy_Cradock", "word_count": 518, "label": "Ambassador", "people": "Percy Cradock"}

After his father's death, Barrows was sent to school until he became ill around the age of 7 or 8. Barrows' doctor recommended that he leave school. After leaving school, Barrows' mother, Jane Weekes Barrow, sent him to work for a printing press owned by Richard Hoe, a cousin of Barrows' late father. There he learned to be a messenger and telegrapher, as well as shorthand. He tried to enlist in the United States Navy during the American Civil War but was rejected because of poor health. Barrows then went to a hydropathic sanitarium for treatment and became the personal secretary of the presiding doctor. There he met his future wife, Isabel C. Barrows, who was a medical student at the sanitarium at the time. During his stay at the sanitarium, Samuel picked up the nickname \\\"June\\\" because it was an apt description of his sunny personality. He then used \\\"June\\\" as his middle name or \\\"J\\\" as his middle initial for the rest of his life. Finding a calling to be a minister, he attended the Harvard Divinity School in 1871. While there, he was the Boston correspondent of the New York Tribune. After graduating, he served for four years as minister of the First Parish in Dorchester, Massachusetts and then became editor of the Unitarian publication, the Christian Register for the next sixteen. Barrows went with the Yellowstone Expedition of 1873, under the command of General Stanley, and with the Black Hills Expedition in 1874, commanded by General Custer. In 1873 he took part in the Battle of the Tongue River. Throughout his life, Barrows was an advocate for women's suffrage, African American rights, assimilation of Native Americans and prison reform. He fought for these reforms throughout his life and time in Congress. On the international stage, Barrows was an activist for ending hunger and achieving peace \u2013 one of his first actions in Congress was to send ships carrying grain to India to feed the starving and later he served as executive secretary of the Russian Famine Relief Commission. Barrows was elected as a Republican to the Fifty-fifth Congress (March 4, 1897 \u2013 March 3, 1899). During his term in Congress, he promoted legislation that would remove Native Americans from reservations, believing that cultural assimilation would lead to equality. Also a pacifist, Barrows bitterly opposed the Spanish\u2013American War. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1898 to the Fifty-sixth Congress. After a failed nomination for Librarian of Congress, he accepted a position as the Corresponding Secretary of the New York Prison Association where he would serve from 1899 to 1909. In this role, Barrows successfully advocated for juvenile courts, parole, probation, indeterminate sentences, and improved prison conditions. Additionally, he argued forcefully against capital punishment and the fee system. Barrows was the American representative to the International Prison Congress of 1895, 1900, and 1905, and president-elect of the 1910 congress before his death. Barrows died on April 21, 1909, of pneumonia in New York City\u2019s Presbyterian Hospital.

The next year, 1890, fortunes were reversed when Jacks beat Shackle in the final in three sets. In 1891 and 1892 it was again Shackle who won the title by defeating Jacks in the final, both times in three sets. Shackles's fourth and final title at Beckenham came in 1893 when she won in straight sets against Ruth Legh. Jacks and Shackle also met in the final of the 1891 women's singles events at the British Covered Court Championships. In 1890 Jacks had won the first edition of the women's singles event, played on wood courts at the Queen's Club in London, with the loss of only one game in the final. The following year, 1891, Shackle won the final against Jacks in straight sets. Shackle successfully defended her title in 1892 and 1893 against May Arbuthnot, each time in three sets. Between 1886 and 1895 Shackle participated in five editions of the singles event at the Wimbledon Championships and achieved her best result in 1892 and 1893 when she reached the final of the all-comer's tournament. During both these years only seven women took part in the singles event and both times Shackle lost the all-comers' final in straight sets to Blanche Bingley, who on both occasions would lose the challenge round to Lottie Dod. She did not compete in the doubles or mixed doubles events at Wimbledon. In 1894 Shackle was unable to defend her titles due to a family death. Shackle was a baseline player and her game was based on accuracy and steadiness. She was the first known ambidextrous tennis player. In addition to lawn tennis she also competed in table tennis.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "TennisPlayer", "wiki_name": "Maud_Shackle", "word_count": 317, "label": "Tennis Player", "people": "Maud Shackle"}

About this sudden rise through the rankings, in his 2012 endgame book Amateur to IM, he notes that \\\"a careful study of the endgame sparked the biggest leap forward in my own game\\\". As well as his double British championship titles, tournament wins by Hawkins include the British Rapidplay Chess Championships in 2012 and 2014, making him (as of August 2015) the current British champion at both standard and rapid time limits. In 2013 he tied for first place in the 18th Vienna Open with Stanislav Novikov, Batuhan Dastan, Hagen Poetsch, Ralf \u00c5kesson and Kacper Drozdowski. Hawkins was part of the English contingent at the rapidplay tournament of the 2014 London Chess Classic. His game against former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik at that event was notable for its simultaneous attacks against both castled kings, and for the \\\"exquisite Zugzwang\\\" to which Hawkins succumbed.

{"text": "Morton Lyon \\\"Mort\\\" Sahl (born May 11, 1927) is a Canadian-born American comedian and social satirist, considered by filmmaker Robert B. Weide to be the first modern stand-up comedian since Will Rogers, a humorist in the early 20th century. Sahl pioneered a style of social satire which pokes fun at political and current event topics using improvised monologues and only a newspaper as a prop. Sahl spent his early years in Los Angeles and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he made his professional stage debut at the hungry i nightclub in 1953. His popularity grew quickly, and after a year at the club he traveled the country doing shows at established nightclubs, theaters and college campuses. In 1960 he became the first comedian to have a cover story written about them by Time magazine. He appeared on various television shows, played a number of film roles, and performed a one-man show on Broadway. Television host Steve Allen claimed that Sahl was \\\"the only real political philosopher we have in modern comedy.\\\" His social satire performances broke new ground in live entertainment, as a stand-up comic talking about the real world of politics at that time was considered \\\"revolutionary.\\\" It inspired many later comics to become stage comedians, including Lenny Bruce, Jonathan Winters and Woody Allen. Allen credits Sahl's new style of humor with \\\"opening up vistas for people like me.\\\" Numerous politicians became his fans, with John F. Kennedy asking him to write his jokes for campaign speeches. After Kennedy's assassination in 1963, however, Sahl became obsessed with what he saw as the Warren Report's inaccuracy and conclusions, and spoke about it often during his shows. This alienated much of his audience and led to a decline in his popularity for the remainder of the 1960s. By the 1970s, however, his shows and popularity staged a partial comeback which continues to the present.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Comedian", "wiki_name": "Mort_Sahl", "word_count": 316, "label": "Comedian", "people": "Mort Sahl"}

{"text": "Sh\u014dg\u014d Kuniba (February 5, 1935 - July 14, 1992) was a Japanese teacher of karate and iaido His adoptive father (biological uncle) was K\u014dsei Kokuba, who began training him at the age of five years. Kuniba was taught by many masters of the day including: \\n* Kenwa Mabuni - Shit\u014d-ry\u016b Karate \\n* K\u014dsei Kokuba - Motobu-ha Karate-d\u014d \\n* Itoh Asakichi - Judo \\n* Ishii Gogetsu - Mugai-ry\u016b Iaido \\n* Sh\u014dshin Nagamine - Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b Karate \\n* Kenko Nakaima - Kobud\u014d \\n* Kosha Shojin - B\u014d and nunchaku \\n* Junko Yamaguchi - Tonfa \\n* Shioda Gozo - Aikido \\n* Ryusei Tomoyori - Kenyu-ry\u016b Karate When he was 24 years old, Sh\u014dg\u014d Kuniba became the youngest karate system head (S\u014dke) in Japan, taking over the style his adoptive father (K\u014dsei Kokuba) had inherited from Motobu Ch\u014dki. He thus became the Sandai Soke of Ryukyu Karate Motobu-ha (Choki Motobu was Shodai Soke; Kosei Kokuba was Nidai Soke). Kuniba was known for integrating the power of karate with the sensitivity of aikido and other traditional martial arts, in a style he called \\\"Motobu-ha Shito-ryu.\\\" This style is structured to adopt concepts and techniques from other styles to form a modern system replete with traditional values, but with an open-minded philosophy. Shogo Kuniba was the Shodai Soke of Motobu-ha Shito-ryu Karate-do. It is sometimes referred to as Kuniba-ha Karate-do. A book titled A Primer of Kuniba-ha Karate-do: The Style of Shogo Kuniba was written and published in 1985 by James Herndon; it was republished in 2009. At the age of 17, Kuniba started learning Mugai Ryu Iaido from Ishii Gogetsu, a practitioner of Mugai Ryu, himself a student of Nakagawa Shiryo Shinichi, 11th and last headmaster of Mugai Ryu. Kuniba proceeded to practice Mugai Ryu for the next 40 years. However, the style of Mugai Ryu, as taught by Ishii Gogetsu and then modified by Kuniba is sufficiently different from other branches of Mugai Ryu (Mugai Ryu splintered with the death of the Nakagawa, so no single orthodox line exists), that this branch of Mugai Ryu is commonly known as Kuniba Ryu. Amongst the most noticeable differences, are addition of kata not present in Mugai Ryu, that are thought to be added by both Ishii Gogetsu and Sh\u014dg\u014d Kuniba. Kuniba applied his knowledge of aikido, jujutsu, judo and other arts to the bunkai of karate kata. This made for very creative variations on techniques, which became his hallmark. He created a new style, Kuniba-ry\u016b Goshind\u014d (aka Goshin Bud\u014d Jujutsu), which literally means Kuniba's style of self-defense. In Japan, Sh\u014dg\u014d Kuniba was treated as a Meijin (brilliant man). When Kuniba died on July 14, 1992, the organizations he had led split over leadership disagreements. Kunio Tatsuno became S\u014dke of Motobu-Ha Karate-d\u014d and Kaicho of Seishinkai. In the U.S., Kuniba named William H. Price as second S\u014dke of both Kuniba-ryu Karate-Do and Kuniba-ry\u016b Goshind\u014d on March 16, 1992. Several American karateka under Kuniba followed his named U.S. successor. Chikubu-Kai was created on September 8, 1995, to continue his teachings. However, upon the death of Kunio Tatsuno, Kuniba-Kai was established in Japan by the Kuniba family in 1999. Many Shihan loyal to Kuniba have affiliated with Kuniba-Kai, headed by Kozo Kuniba and Kosuke Kuniba. The style is called Kuniba-ryu Karate-Do in the U.S. and Motobu-Ha Shit\u014d-ry\u016b in Japan. Today, the Seishinkai (the Karate organization originally started by Kosei Kokuba) still exists to promote Shit\u014d-ry\u016b (however, the term \\\"Motobu-Ha\\\" is no longer claimed). A new International Seishinkai Karate-d\u014d Union (ISKU) was formed by Kunio Tatsuno in 1999; in 2007, Sadatomu Harada formed the Seishinkai International Shitoryu Karate-d\u014d Union (SISKU). Neither ISKU nor SISKU claim Motobu-Ha. Kuniba-Kai has exclusive rights to that style per the Japan Karate Federation (JKF).

Belden was born in San Francisco into a wealthy California family. His grandfather, Josiah Belden, was an early California pioneer who made millions in San Francisco real estate and was the first Mayor of San Jose. After graduating from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Charles Belden bought his first camera to record a European tour with his school friend, Eugene Phelps. The highlight of the tour was a journey through Russia in Belden's 1908 Packard, the first automobile to make such a trip in the country. After the trip, Belden went to work as a cowboy on the Phelps (Pitchfork) Ranch in Wyoming. In 1912, Belden married Eugene's sister, Frances. The couple had three children, Annice, Margot, and Mary Elizabeth, who died while still a toddler. Eugene's father died in 1922, leaving Eugene and Charles to take over management of the Pitchfork Ranch. Belden's 1921\u20131940 photographs of the Pitchfork Ranch were widely published, including in The Saturday Evening Post, National Geographic, and on the cover of Life magazine. Airplanes became a fascination for Belden. In the late 1920s, Charles became involved in raising antelope and sending them by airplane to zoos around the world, including some to Germany in the Hindenburg. He helped to pioneer the process of planting fish from the air and filmed the experience for future reference. In addition, he helped the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission conduct a census of wildlife herd populations using aerial photographs. Estate taxes, mismanagement, and an agricultural depression that began in 1921 took their toll on the Pitchfork and the ranch fell into decline. To meet expenses, in the 1930s the family turned their home into a dude ranch, but this response did not stop the financial drain. After many years of strained relations, Charles divorced Frances in 1940 and moved to Florida with a new wife, Verna Steele Belden.

Snyder had watched Jeff Lahti play throughout his short baseball career, over this time Snyder had been inspired by Lathi and impressed by his charismatic style. Snyder proposed to the governor of Oregon that a children's health clinic be named in honor of the baseballer, he felt that the name would inspire and give hope to sickly children in Lahti's home town. Initial talks between the governors where promising but further support was needed to get the project off the ground. Unfortunately talks broke down when two undisclosed members of the Government of Michigan intercepted the conversations and advised John Kitzhaber to not move forward with the project.

As a house designer for Lord & Taylor, Brigance was best known for bathing costumes and play clothes, and for his clever use of flattering details such as pleats and darts. During the 1930s Brigance was a rare example of a male working in the female-dominated world of American sportswear design. In the late 1930s, he was regularly mentioned alongside Clare Potter as a leading name in mid-range priced sportswear. Like Potter, Brigance was skilled at to designing smart, fashionable clothing which could easily be mass-produced, making his work attractive to manufacturers as well as to customers. After serving in the Army during the Second World War, Brigance resumed designing for Lord & Taylor and for Charles W. Nudelman; branching out into a wider range of garments, including suits, coats, and formal wear. He was known for his clever use of unusually textured and/or unexpected fabrics, such as a flannel swimsuit, and in 1953, reportedly designed over half of the textiles in his collections himself. In 1953 Brigance was awarded the Coty Award for his designs. Brigance continued designing during the 1960s and 1970s, focusing on swimwear for various companies. One of his swimsuit designs for Gabar, produced before his retirement in the late 1970s, was still a best-selling design for the company in 1990.

Amongst his most important works in this field are his paintings of St Mark's Basilica in Venice and the Cappella Palatina in Palermo. In 1880, Wilberg painted a panorama of the Gulf of Naples for the Berlin Fishery exhibition, which gained him recognition amongst insiders. In the year before he went on a trip to Pergamon with the director of the Berlin Collection of Classical Antiquities. It was here that Wilberg made a series of sketches of the Acropolis which he later utilised for paintings. He acquired a large knowledge in ancient architecture and used this to conceive reconstructions of Roman buildings \u2013 one of which was later hung in Berlin's famous Caf\u00e9 Bauer. Wilberg's last major project was a great panorama of the Baths of Caracalla which he created for the Berlin Hygiene exhibition of 1882. This last major work was incinerated when the exhibition hall caught fire and Wilberg only had time to save a few paintings and drawings. After the fire, Wilberg travelled to France in the company of Werner Ludwig Pietsch in order to paint in Sedan; on his way there, he got ill while visiting Paris. He died there shortly afterwards. In October and November 1882 a special exhibition including more than 677 of Wilberg's works was held in Berlin's National Gallery. Some of the paintings from this exhibition, Villa Mondagrone and a number of oil sketches in watercolour and pencil drawings, were transferred to the National Gallery's ownership. In 1883, the Old Masters Picture Gallery in Dresden was presented with Memento Mori, one of Wilberg's motifs of the Sabini Mountains in Italy.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Painter", "wiki_name": "Christian_Wilberg", "word_count": 388, "label": "Painter", "people": "Christian Wilberg"}

{"text": "J. Larry Jones (born September 2, 1956 in Hopkinsville, Kentucky) is an American Thoroughbred horse racing trainer. A former commercial farmer, he embarked on a career as a professional trainer in 1982. Jones trained at principally at Ellis Park Racecourse in Henderson, Kentucky, and at Oaklawn Park Race Track in Hot Springs, Arkansas, before coming into national prominence in 2007 with the front-running bay colt Hard Spun. Hard Spun brought Jones into the spotlight with his runner-up finishes in the Kentucky Derby and Breeder's Cup Classic, as well as impressive victories in the Lane's End, King's Bishop, and Kentucky Cup Classic Stakes. In 2008, Jones was again in the nation's spotlight, this time with the talented fillies Proud Spell and Eight Belles. He saddled Proud Spell to a decisive win over a sloppy track in the Kentucky Oaks (G1). (Proud Spell went on to win the Eclipse Award as top three-year-old filly that year, becoming Jones's first Eclipse Award winner.) The day after the Kentucky Oaks, Jones saddled his other top filly, Eight Belles, to run in the Kentucky Derby. Following the race, Eight Belles, the first filly to run second in the Derby in over one hundred years, broke both front legs and was humanely euthanized on the track. After Eight Belles' breakdown, Jones was accused of drugging the filly or running an unsound horse and received hate mail from people who felt that he was to blame for the tragedy. Tests done on Eight Belles proved she had run clean. In the summer, Jones announced that after one more year of training, he would retire, partially because he wanted to spend more time with his family. In 2009, Jones had two top Kentucky Derby hopefuls in Old Fashioned and Friesan Fire. Old Fashioned won the Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct in a romp and became the early favorite for the Derby. He also won the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park by open lengths before he was upset by Win Willy in the Rebel Stakes. In the Arkansas Derby, Old Fashioned finished second to Papa Clem and was retired after it was discovered the son of Unbridled's Song had slab-fractured his knee. Friesan Fire impressed on his way to the Derby, sweeping the Lecomte, Risen Star, and the Louisiana Derby at Fair Grounds in Louisiana. In the 2009 Kentucky Derby, Friesan Fire was the favorite. He broke badly, was stepped on and bumped at the start of the race, suffered a bad trip, and faded to second-to-last place. Friesan Fire went on to run in the Preakness Stakes. Other Jones-trained horses, such as Just Jenda (a stakes-winning filly owned by Larry's wife, Cindy), Solar Flare, Maren's Meadow, Payton D'Oro, Kodiak Kowboy, and It Happened Again, continued to compete that season. On November 7, 2009, Jones retired, and his wife, Cindy, took over training duties at the barn. Jones became an assistant to Cindy and galloped horses in the mornings for her. The Joneses are based at Delaware Park in Wilmington, Delaware, in the summer, and at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in the winter. Their current barn stars include Just Jenda (2009 Monmouth Oaks winner), Payton D'Oro (2009 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes winner), and No Such Word (2010 Honeybee Stakes winner).", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "HorseTrainer", "wiki_name": "J._Larry_Jones", "word_count": 541, "label": "Horse Trainer", "people": "J.

Eventually the Esquire photograph would become the basis for a documentary, A Great Day in Harlem. His work was provocative, experimental, and playful, sometimes rejected by magazines for nudity or irreverence. Kane said of his portraiture: \\\"You have to own people...grab them, twist them into what you want to say about them.\\\" He was quoted in the book The Nikon Image as saying: \\\"I've always considered myself an illustrator, a literate photographer interested in producing images that reflect the essence of an idea...I wanted to interpret the human scene rather than simply record it.\\\" Art Kane is credited in the book Stainless Steel Illusion for the photograph of John DeLorean with the DeLorean DMC-12 sports car that was the basis for the only magazine advertisement ever created by DeLorean Motor Company.

His first exhibition consisted mostly of large-format acrylic paintings of imaginary seals and stamps; he would retain the flatness and limited color range of these works, but would move into the depiction of bodies and cartoon characters, the latter of which led him to be grouped with Pop Art as the 1960s progressed. The spareness of his technique often seems more akin to the school known as Minimalism, however, and indeed his closest personal associations were with artists such as Dan Flavin and Donald Judd, the latter of whom wrote a laudatory essay on Wesley's early work and later set aside a space for him at his complex in Marfa, Texas. Wesley himself considers his work to be aligned with Surrealism, and many of his paintings since the 1960s have taken this dimension yet further, while retaining an extremely limited range of colors and a sign-like flatness. Several retrospectives of his work have been held, the most recent at the P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in 2000.

{"text": "Aldo Weber Vieira da Rosa (November 15, 1917 - June 8, 2015) was a Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. His research interests were in ionospheric processes, energy processes and renewable energy. He is the author of \\\"Fundamentals of Renewable Energy Processes\\\" and \\\"Fundamentals of Electronics\\\". He is also the holder of a US patent on the process for the production of ammonia. Da Rosa was born in Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil. After graduating from the Brazilian Military Academy and the Escola Militar de Realengo both in Rio de Janeiro, he entered the Brazilian Air Force. In the early 1940s he was stationed in the US as part of a cooperative military program, and during this time he was relocated from Washington, D.C., to the Alameda Naval Air Station in the San Francisco Bay area. This gave him the opportunity to attend Stanford for the first time and to study electrical engineering. Although he did not have an undergraduate degree, his technical experience enabled him to be admitted into the graduate program. He completed an Electrical Engineer\u2019s (EE) degree and around the same time, in 1944, he married fellow Stanford student Aili Ranta (M.S., 1943) and moved to Harvard University. In 1945 Aldo moved back to Brazil with his new wife. For the next twenty years Aldo was extraordinarily active in what we now refer to as aerospace activities in Brazil, while still attached to the Brazilian Air Force. From 1945 to 1951 he founded and was the first head of the Research and Standardization division of the Diretoria de Rotas A\u00e9reas (the Brazilian FAA). Then, from 1952 to 1953 he was Associate Professor of Electronics at ITA, an engineering college in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos. In 1954 he founded and was the first director of the Instituto de Pesquinas e Desenvolvimento (IPD) and in 1956 he became chairman of the Brazilian National Research Council. He resigned from this council following a serious injury to his leg during an international glider competition in France. From 1961 to 1963 he founded and was first chairman of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espacias, the Brazilian equivalent of NASA. Following all these activities, he returned to Stanford in 1963, with his family, to obtain a Ph.D. In the early 1960s, da Rosa was a helicopter test pilot for the \\\"Beija Flor\\\", a helicopter designed by Heinrich Focke. Da Rosa retired from the Brazilian Air Force as Brigadier General in 1965 and completed his Stanford Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1966 under Professor (and later astronaut) Owen K. Garriott. His research involved the first full-physics model of the electron distribution in the ionosphere including thermal processes to describe the electron and ion temperatures. This model predicted the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere that was first measured at Stanford University using radio signals from the Soviet Union\u2019s Sputnik, a particularly important topic at the time given the developing competition in space between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Appointed a Research Associate in 1966, and then a Senior Research Associate (1969-1980), Aldo became a Professor (Research) in Electrical Engineering in 1980. During this time, his interests gradually turned more to the fundamentals of energy processes and renewable energy. His classes on renewable energy were greatly appreciated by the students and he continued teaching these energy classes until 2011, well after his retirement and conversion to Professor (Emeritus) in 1983. An active Masters Swimmer, da Rosa broke 99 National Records and 37 World Records. He currently still holds the world records in the 85-89 age group in the 200 meter IM and 200 meter breast stroke. He was inducted into the International Masters Swimming Hall of Fame in 2004. In March 2010, da Rosa was awarded the Gr\u00e3-Cruz da Ordem Nacional do M\u00e9rito Cient\u00edfico, an honor bestowed by the President of Brazil upon Brazilian and foreign personalities recognized for their scientific and technical contributions to the cause and development of science in Brazil. Da Rosa attracted large numbers of students to his renewable energy classes at Stanford. He lectured on renewable energy topics, with an emphasis on classical physics. da Rosa died in Palo Alto, California at the age of 97 on June 8, 2015.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Ambassador", "wiki_name": "Aldo_da_Rosa", "word_count": 701, "label": "Ambassador", "people": "Aldo da Rosa"}

He graduated from Queen's University Belfast in 1980 with a BA in French and Classical Greek. He taught French language for seventeen years at school. He worked the after-dinner comic entertainment circuit for many years, and he felt that his language background contributed to his voice-over impressions. During the Troubles, comedians needed to adopt a non-partisan stance, so his stage name was a neutral-sounding non-Catholic pseudonym. Sean Crummey was well known for his hilariously accurate depictions and his gentle, humorous political satire. He impersonated dozens of voices, particularly of Northern Ireland politicians. Some of Crummey's favourite voices to impersonate were the late PUP leader David Ervine, Pope John Paul II, and Bill McLaren. He also wrote and acted in Stormont, a stage play produced by Martin Lynch and directed by Michael Poynor, that ran at the Theatre at the Mill in Newtownabbey mid-September to early October 2010. On stage, Crummey alternately mimicked two politicians, Ulster Unionist Michael McGimpsey and Sinn F\u00e9in's Gerry Kelly. He died from a cancer-related illness just a day after his final show was broadcast. Politicians from across the political spectrum gave respectful tribute to his comic genius, penetrating humour, and talented political commentary. His funeral was attended by an unusually large number of famous individuals from all walks of life. A tribute show was broadcast on New Year's Day, 2012.

In 1945, she established the first mothers' milk bank at Delaware Hospital (now Wilmington Hospital) in Wilmington, Delaware. Handy was born in Smyrna, Delaware and was the daughter of L. Irving Handy, a U.S. Representative. She attended Goucher College and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine from which she graduated in 1916. She was the first native-born female Delawarean to become a doctor and was also the state\u2019s first pediatrician. In 1918, during an outbreak of Spanish influenza in the Wilmington area, Handy was asked by the Board of Health to open a paediatric ward at People's Settlement staffed by volunteers and with very little equipment. She subsequently established a pediatric clinic and became Assistant Chief, and in 1921, Chief, of Pediatrics at Delaware Hospital where she set up a nursery for premature babies. Handy collected surplus breast milk in the community to feed the babies of mothers who could not breast feed, and in 1945 founded the Mother's Milk Bank with Margaret Trentman, a hospital board member whose baby son had died because she was unable to nurse him. The bank supplied breast milk to mothers throughout the United States as well as for research purposes, for 40 years. She also helped to establish ophthalmology as a speciality in Delaware, with Norman Cutler becoming the first state-certified ophthalmologist in 1947. Handy received a number of awards including the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary's Elizabeth Blackwell Citation (honoring female doctors) and the Annie Jump Cannon medal from Wesley College as well as the 1953 Josiah Marvel Cup for outstanding contributions to the state and to society in the field of children's medicine. The Margaret Handy Lectureship at Christiana Hospital in [Newark, Delaware] is named for her. Andrew Wyeth painted The Children's Doctor, a \\\"votive-like\\\" portrait of Handy, in 1949 after she treated his son Nicholas at his remote farm.

Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman CBE (19 May 1928 \u2013 16 December 1982) was an influential English design engineer, inventor, and builder in the automotive industry, and founder of Lotus Cars. He studied structural engineering at University College London, joined the University of London Air Squadron and learned to fly. Chapman left UCL without a degree in 1948, resitting his final Mathematics paper in 1949 and obtaining his degree a year late. He briefly joined the Royal Air Force in 1948, being offered a permanent commission but turning this down in favour of a swift return to civilian life. After a couple of false starts Chapman joined the British Aluminium company, using his civil engineering skills to attempt to sell aluminium as a viable structural material for buildings. In 1952 he founded the sports car company Lotus Cars. Chapman initially ran Lotus in his spare time, assisted by a group of enthusiasts. His knowledge of the latest aeronautical engineering techniques would prove vital towards achieving the major automotive technical advances he is remembered for. His design philosophy focused on cars with light weight and fine handling instead of bulking up on horsepower and spring rates, which he famously summarised as \\\"Adding power makes you faster on the straights. Subtracting weight makes you faster everywhere.\\\" Under his direction, Team Lotus won seven Formula One Constructors' titles, six Drivers' Championships, and the Indianapolis 500 in the United States, between 1962 and 1978.

While at Lafayette High School in Lexington, he was named the 1979 Kentucky \\\"Mr. Basketball\\\", an honor given to the top high school player in the state of Kentucky. In addition to \\\"Mr. Basketball\\\", he was also named a McDonald's and Parade High School All-American. Minniefield played his college ball at the University of Kentucky (UK), where he became a member of the 1,000 point club. In 1983, he was drafted in the second round (33rd overall) by the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. The 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m), 180 lb (82 kg) guard played three seasons in NBA, making stops in Cleveland, Houston, Golden State, and Boston. Minniefield began regularly using marijuana at age 14. Minniefield, who has been sober since the early 1990s, told a group of top high school prospects in 2007 that \\\"My younger kids have never seen me take a drink. They don't know the daddy the older kids know. They know a totally different guy.\\\" (Minniefield was a father of three children by the time he graduated from high school, and has two children from his current marriage). His drug problem continued into college. He admitted to having carried a vial of cocaine with him regularly during his senior year at UK, and frequently took hits of the drug before games. Most notably, he admitted in 2007 that he and several teammates had gone to a park in Knoxville, Tennessee the night before Kentucky's showdown with Louisville in the 1983 NCAA Mideast Regional final and smoked marijuana. He also said that he smoked more marijuana after returning to his hotel room. As fate would have it, he had the ball late in the game, with UK clinging to a narrow lead. He went into the lane and threw up a tentative shot that UofL center Charles Jones blocked. The Cardinals went on to force overtime and then dominated the extra period, winning 80-68. He would later say about the incident, Minniefield's drug use eventually contributed to the early end of his NBA career. He returned to Lexington, but wound up serving a year in jail after writing bad checks and violating probation on those charges. His first wife divorced him and he left Lexington \\\"penniless\\\". He found his way to the John Lucas Drug Abuse Center in Houston; Minniefield would say of Lucas, \\\"I finally found that person who talked my language.

These included Richard Trevithick, William West, and, more importantly, Arthur Woolf. In 1797, Harvey's daughter, Jane, married Richard Trevithick. Harvey & Co. built up a reputation for world class stationary beam engines designed to pump water out of the deep Cornish tin and copper mines. The Cornish beam engine became world-famous and was exported overseas, and remains the largest type of beam engine ever constructed; the largest of all, with a 144-inch-diameter (3,700 mm) cylinder which powered eight separate beams, was used to drain the Haarlemmermeer in the Netherlands\u2014it is preserved in the Museum De Cruquius. Harvey's also produced a range of products, from hand tools to ocean-going ships including the USS Cornubia. The company was expanded by John's son, Henry, in collaboration with Arthur Woolf, who was the chief engineer. At that time it was the main mining engine foundry in the world, with an international market served through their own port at Foundry Town, Hayle. Harvey's of Hayle reached their peak in the early- to mid-19th century and then, along with the Cornish mining industry in general, suffered a gradual and slow decline. Harvey's acquired the Cornish Copper Company in 1875.

Much of his career was devoted to the architecture of education and he worked extensively for various schools, notably Giggleswick and his own alma mater Brighton College. Jackson designed the former town hall in Tipperary Town, Ireland. He also worked on many parish churches and the college chapel at the University of Wales, Lampeter. He is also famous for designing the chapel (amongst other things) at Radley College. The City of Oxford High School in George Street, Oxford was another building designed by him. He was educated at Brighton College and then Wadham College, Oxford, of which he wrote a history, before being articled as a pupil to Sir George Gilbert Scott. Jackson was a prolific author of carefully researched works in architectural history, often illustrated with sketches made during his extensive travels. He and Norman Shaw edited \\\"Architecture, A Profession or an Art\\\" published in 1892, to which William H. White replied by publishing \\\"The Architect and his artists, an essay to assist the public in considering the question is architecture a profession or an art\\\". This had been part of the course of events which resulted in the passing of the Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938 which established the statutory Register of Architects and monopolistic restrictions on the use of the vernacular word \\\"architect\\\", imposed with threat of penalty on prosecution for infringement. In 1919, Jackson wrote a collection of supernatural stories, Six Ghost Stories. These stories were written under the influence of M. R. James, and Jackson expressed admiration for James' work in the book's introduction.

From an early age, he had been a disciple of Yang Chengfu, and later a family member as he married Zou Kuei Cheng, the great-granddaughter of Yang Chien Hou. Fu Zhongwen was born in Yongnian, Hebei province. As a child, he would watch people practise t'ai chi and imitate their moves before beginning his training with Master Yang Chengfu at the young age of 9. Zhongwen\u2019s personal diligence and application in learning t'ai chi ch'uan saw him advance rapidly in the knowledge and expertise of t'ai chi. As Zhongwen matured, he accompanied Yang in his travels around China from Wuhan to Guangzhou, demonstrating t'ai chi and helping to teach along the way. Yang Chengfu would teach and Zhongwen would demonstrate. Fu Zhongwen would often accept challenges from other martial artists, not once failing to uphold his master's honour. Fu Zhongwen was often called upon by his master to represent him in pushing hands competitions and he earned the reputation of being an undefeatable opponent. So highly regarded was he by his peers, that Yang's first disciple Chen Weiming wrote a letter to him after Chengfu's death, acknowledging the excellence of Zhongwen's accomplishment and the accuracy with which he reflected their master\u2019s art. In 1944, Fu Zhongwen founded the Yongnian Tai Chi Association in order to carry on the work of his master in spreading t'ai chi ch'uan to all people. When he founded the Yongnian Association, he selected diligence, perseverance, respect, and sincerity as their motto. Fu Zhongwen lived his life according to the above motto. The reason he chose Yongnian as the name was because Yong Nian in Chinese means longevity - the main purpose of establishing the association was to teach T'ai chi, allowing the people to benefit from practicing t'ai chi to live longer. In 1959, the PRC featured Fu Zhongwen\u2019s t'ai chi sabre in its international sports publication. The PRC also published his book, entitled \\\"Yang Family Tai Chi Chuan\\\" in 1963. In 1972, the Tongji University in Shanghai carried out a scientific research on the therapeutic value of t'ai chi on patients with Fu Zhongwen and his son Fu Sheng Yuan as instructors. After 3 months, the results achieved with some medical conditions including heart diseases, spleen dysfunction, arthritis and insomnia. This propelled the Ministry of Sports to officially recognize the therapeutic value of T'ai chi. Fu Zhongwen was the type of man who was willing to teach t'ai chi to whom ever wanted to learn for free; the only benefit to him was the knowledge that people were doing t'ai chi and gaining health from it. Fu Zhongwen is a true legacy in the t'ai chi world. Fu Zhongwen had dedicated his life to practicing and teaching T'ai chi. He was voted as one of the One Hundred Living Treasures of China and it was a great loss to the martial arts world and a greater loss to his family when he died in Shanghai on September 25, 1994 at age 92.

He believed that the brain is the \\\"most incredible thing in the universe\\\" and therefore important to study. He became widely known for writing best-selling case histories about his patients' disorders, with some of his books adapted for stage and film. After Sacks received his medical degree from the Queen's College, Oxford in 1960, he interned at Middlesex Hospital (part of University College, London) before moving to the U.S. He then interned at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco and completed his residency in neurology and neuropathology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He relocated to New York in 1965, where he first worked under a paid fellowship in neurochemistry and neuropathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Upon realising that the neuro-research career he envisioned for himself would be a poor fit, in 1966 he began serving as neurologist at Beth Abraham Hospital's chronic-care facility in the Bronx. While there, he worked with a group of survivors of the 1920s sleeping sickness encephalitis lethargica, who had been unable to move on their own for decades. His treatment of those patients became the basis of his book Awakenings. In the period from 1966 to 1991 he was a neurological consultant to various New York City nursing homes, hospitals, and at the Bronx Psychiatric Center. Sacks was the author of numerous best-selling books, mostly collections of case studies of people with neurological disorders. His writings have been featured in a wide range of media; the New York Times called him a \\\"poet laureate of contemporary medicine\\\", and \\\"one of the great clinical writers of the 20th century\\\". His books include a wealth of narrative detail about his experiences with patients, and how they coped with their conditions, often illuminating how the normal brain deals with perception, memory and individuality. Awakenings (1973) was adapted into an Academy Award-nominated film in 1990, starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. He and his book Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain were the subject of \\\"Musical Minds\\\", an episode of the PBS series Nova.

From February 20, 1953, to May 16, 1964, he starred in Bitte in zehn Minuten zu Tisch on the WDR, assisted by his wife Erika, and provided his audience with suggestions for creative cooking in 185 broadcasts. Wilmenrod, also known as \\\"Don Clemente\\\", wore a trademark apron with a caricature by Mirko Szewczuk. The dishes presented were characterized by the general scarcity of the post-war period, and Wilmenrod was not ashamed to use canned vegetables, instant sauces, and even ketchup. While this may not measure up to the current state of the culinary art, he had a great influence on the post-war generation in Germany: his programmes and cookbooks were blockbusters, and when he presented a cod recipe, for instance, cod would be sold out for weeks. In one memorable incident, after being accused by a viewer of not having invented the \\\"filled strawberry\\\" himself, Wilmenrod put a long cook's knife against his chest and swore to kill himself if a single viewer who had previously eaten filled strawberry were to call. He committed suicide in 1967 in a hospital in Munich after being diagnosed with stomach cancer.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Chef", "wiki_name": "Clemens_Wilmenrod", "word_count": 259, "label": "Chef", "people": "Clemens Wilmenrod"}
{"text": "Sarah Hall Ladd (April 13, 1860 \u2013 March 30, 1927) was an early 20th-century American pictorial and landscape photographer. Ladd was born Sarah L. Hall in Somerville, Massachusetts, the daughter of John Gill Hall and Sarah Cushing. Little is known about her childhood. On September 7, 1881 she married Charles E. Ladd, a West Coast businessman and son of early Portland (Oregon) mayor William S. Ladd. She then moved to Portland with her new husband, and they soon settled into a very comfortable life with an elegant home overlooking the Willamette River. It is not known how Ladd became interested in photography or if she received any formal training. She joined the Oregon Camera Club in September 1899, and by early 1901 a number of her works were exhibited in San Francisco. In 1902, leading New York photographer Alfred Stieglitz formed the Photo-Secession, a group of American photographers who worked to promote photographic pictorialism, and he listed Ladd as an Associate Member. It is not known how he became aware of her photography or if he had even seen her photographs, since most of those she was then taking did not accord with the pictorial tradition. In 1903, Ladd began taking extended trips on the Columbia River on her friend and fellow photographer Lily White\u2019s custom-built houseboat, the Raysark, which contained a darkroom. Some of her most famous photographs of the river were included in an exhibition in 2008 at the Portland Art Museum, \\\"Wild Beauty: Photographs of the Columbia River Gorge, 1867-1957\\\". Ladd had become a successful and highly regarded photographer by the early twentieth century, and many of her photographs were published in The Pacific Monthly magazine (founded by her husband). After about 1904, Ladd\u2019s other responsibilities took time away from her photography. She assisted her husband when he became involved in the preparations for Portland\u2019s 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. In 1910, the Ladds moved to Carlton, Oregon, after Charles became president of the Carlton Consolidated Lumber Company. In spite of these additional obligations, Ladd exhibited fourteen photographs at the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Ladd became prominent in the Christian Science movement from 1911. After her husband died in 1920, she moved to Carmel, California, in late 1924 to join her long-time friend, Lily White.

{"text": "John Peter (J.P.) Hubrick (1858 - January 22, 1930) was an Alaskan adventurer, hunter, newsman and photographer best known for his panoramic photographs of the Wrangell mountain range through the early 1900s. A resident of McCarthy, Alaska, Hubrick started the town's first newspaper, the Cooper Bee in February 1916. The paper lasted for only three issues, however, and as such Hubrick's real legacy is derived from his photographic work. Hubrick's photographic talent is evident in his breathtaking panoramas of the Alaskan countryside. The panoramas can be over six feet long and some are hand-tinted in supreme detail. Some carry scenes from the past. In the Hubrick panorama \\\"Goat Trail,\\\" you can see many goats walking the trail. In the panorama \\\"Taken From Nicolai Hill,\\\" you get a little snapshot of the Hubrick party at a photography shoot. You can see two riding horses, pack animals, and his guide. It is said that most of Mr. Hubrick's photographs were personally sold in or around McCarthy, Alaska circa 1916-1930. The best count (guess) of known existing original photographic prints puts the number around 25. There are also some negatives. Hubrick copies are sold in Alaska for around $45. In addition to art, panoramas like those of J.P. Hubrick have other uses. They are used today to measure and compare changes in snow pack, providing valuable evidence on issues such as global warming. And herd sizes? How many goats, do you think, would be walking that trail today? Hubrick died of diabetes in 1930. His works are considered very rare. The only known museum to have a collection is the University of Alaska.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Photographer", "wiki_name": "J._P._Hubrick", "word_count": 270, "label": "Photographer", "people": "J.

{"text": "Vladimir Pavlovich Malaniuk (Malanyuk) (born July 21, 1957, Arkhangelsk, Soviet Union) is a Ukrainian chess Grandmaster. Considered by many to be one of the more colourful characters on the chess circuit, he has an extraordinary talent for rapid chess, which has been demonstrated at some of the world's most prestigious 'speed chess' tournaments. In 2005, he finished second at the Tallinn (Keres Memorial) rapid event, behind Alexey Shirov but ahead of such luminaries as Anatoly Karpov and Boris Gelfand. The same year, he took the silver medal at the European Rapid Championship, behind the strong Hungarian Grandmaster (GM) Zoltan Gyimesi. His sustained efforts were again rewarded in 2006, when at the Ajaccio Open Rapid event, he finished clear winner, ahead of a large group of strong GMs and Super-GMs including Kasimdzhanov, Milov, Bareev, Motylev, Bologan, Almasi, Smirin, Sokolov, Naiditsch, Sasikiran and Van Wely. Whilst it is rare that older players can achieve this kind of success against more youthful talents, it is not completely unknown. Yuri Balashov is another mature player who enjoys success in such events and it is probable that good quality rapid chess relies as much on intuition as calculation and stamina, giving the experienced professional good chances against younger, sharper, but less knowledgeable minds. Malaniuk has also been a strong player at standard time limits, winning many national and international tournaments, including Minsk 1985, Kostroma 1985 (USSR Ch. Semi-final), Lvov 1986 and Frunze 1987 on the road to securing his Grandmaster title (awarded in 1987). There were further victories recorded at Forl\u00ec in 1990 and 1992, Porto San Giorgio 1994, Minsk 1997 Krasnodar 2001, Arkhangelsk 2002, Krasnodar 2002, Koszalin 2002, Kolobrzeg 2003, Krak\u00f3w 2003 and Mielno 2006. Notable runner-up performances include Baku 1983, Tallinn 1987, Lvov 1988, \u015awidnica 2001 and Krak\u00f3w 2004. He was a regular participant of the Soviet Championships between 1983 and 1991; his best finish occurring in 1986, when he shared second place behind Vitaly Tseshkovsky. In Ukraine, he has thus far been the national champion on three occasions, in 1980, 1981 and 1986. In team chess, he played for Ukraine in the Moscow 1994, Yerevan 1996 and Elista 1998 Chess Olympiads, winning team silver and bronze medals in '96 and '98, respectively. Malaniuk has been credited with an important contribution to chess opening theory. Along with Sergey Dolmatov, Mikhail Gurevich and Evgeny Bareev, his faithful adherence to the Leningrad Dutch Defence (described as a hybrid of the Dutch and the King's Indian) helped shape a dynamic new approach to the system in the 1980s and this led to a dramatic resurgence of interest. That it affords black the opportunity to unbalance the position and fight for the full point is probably its main attraction. The system has since become a popular choice for players at all levels, following the publication of a number of books and theoretical guides. In a more minor capacity, he and Vladimir Akopian are noted for their attempts at reviving the Spielmann Variation (4.Qb3) of the Nimzo-Indian Defence, but have not met with any real success. In 2001, Russian player and chess journalist Evgeny Atarov reported that Malaniuk was severely ill and was undergoing a number of surgical operations, the funding of which had become a cause for concern.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "ChessPlayer", "wiki_name": "Vladimir_Malaniuk", "word_count": 545, "label": "Chess Player", "people": "Vladimir Malaniuk"}

In the beginning he produced cigarette machines, beverage machines and other electronic machinery. In 1904 he produced his first motorcycle, the Elleham motorcycle. In 1903\u20131904 Jacob Ellehammer used his experience constructing motorcycles to build the world's first air-cooled radial engine, a three-cylinder engine which he used as the basis for a more powerful five-cylinder model in 1907. This was installed in his triplane and made a number of short free-flight hops as mentioned below. In 1905, he constructed a monoplane, and in the following year a \\\"semi-biplane\\\". In this latter machine, he made a tethered flight on 12 September 1906. Ellehammer's later inventions included a successful triplane and helicopter. His helicopter was a coaxial machine. A famous photo shows it hovering in 1914, though there is no evidence that it was successful in achieving translational flight.

{"text": "Richard Bernard \\\"Red\\\" Skelton (July 18, 1913 \u2013 September 17, 1997) was an American entertainer. He was best known for his national radio and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program The Red Skelton Show. Skelton, who has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist. Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show. He then spent time on a showboat, worked the burlesque circuit, then entered into vaudeville in 1934. The Doughnut Dunkers, a pantomime sketch of how different people ate doughnuts written by Skelton and his wife launched a career for him in vaudeville, in radio and in films. Skelton's radio career began in 1937 with a guest appearance on The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour which led to his becoming the host of Avalon Time in 1938. He became the host of The Raleigh Cigarette Program in 1941 where many of his comedy characters were created and had a regularly scheduled radio program until 1957. Skelton made his film debut in 1938 alongside Ginger Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in Alfred Santell's Having Wonderful Time, and he went on to appear in numerous musical and comedy films throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, with starring roles in Ship Ahoy (1941), I Dood It (1943), Ziegfeld Follies (1946) and The Clown (1953). He was most eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. The Red Skelton Show made its television premiere on September 30, 1951, on NBC. By 1954, Skelton's program moved to CBS, where it was expanded to one hour and renamed The Red Skelton Hour in 1962. Despite high ratings, his television show was cancelled by CBS in 1970 as the network believed more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power. Skelton moved his program to NBC, where he completed his last year with a regularly scheduled television show in 1971. After he no longer had a television program, Skelton's time was spent making up to 125 personal appearances a year and on his artwork. Skelton's artwork of clowns remained a hobby until 1964 when his wife, Georgia, convinced him to have a showing of his work at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful and Skelton also sold prints and lithographs of them, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At the time of his death, his art dealer believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work. Skelton believed his life's work was to make people laugh; he wanted to be known as a clown because he defined it as being able to do everything. He had a 70-year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans during this time. Many of Skelton's personal and professional effects, including prints of his artwork, were donated to Vincennes University by his widow, where they are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Comedian", "wiki_name": "Red_Skelton", "word_count": 540, "label": "Comedian", "people": "Red Skelton"}

{"text": "Karl Kling (16 September 1910, Gie\u00dfen \u2013 18 March 2003, Gaienhofen on Lake Constance, Germany) was a motor racing driver and manager from Germany. He participated in 11 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 4 July 1954. He achieved 2 podiums, and scored a total of 17 championship points. It is said, that he was born too late and too early. Too late to be in the successful Mercedes team of the 1930s and too early to have a real chance in 1954 and 1955. Unusually, Kling found his way into motorsport via his first job as a reception clerk at Daimler-Benz in the mid-1930s, competing in hillclimb and trials events in production machinery in his spare time. During the Second World War he gained mechanical experience servicing Luftwaffe aircraft, and after the cessation of hostilities he resumed his motorsport involvement in a BMW 328. Kling was instrumental in developing Mercedes' return to international competition in the early 1950s, and his win in the 1952 Carrera Panamericana road race, driving the then-experimental Mercedes-Benz 300SL was a defining point in assuring the Daimler-Benz management that motorsport had a place in Mercedes' future. Called up to the revived Mercedes Grand Prix squad in 1954 he finished less than one second behind the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio on his Formula One debut, taking second place in the 1954 French Grand Prix at the fast Reims-Gueux circuit. This promising start was not to last, and with the arrival of Stirling Moss at Mercedes in 1955 Kling was effectively demoted to third driver. However, away from the World Championship, Kling took impressive victories in both the Berlin Grand Prix (at AVUS, another high-speed circuit) and the Swedish Grand Prix. He left the Formula One team at the end of the season, to succeed Alfred Neubauer as head of Mercedes motorsport. He was in this post during their successful rallying campaigns of the 1960s, occasionally taking the wheel himself.

Engstead began his career in 1926, when he was hired as an office boy by Paramount Pictures' head of studio publicity, Harold Harley. In 1927, Engstead pleased his boss by arranging a photo session for actress Clara Bow with photographer Otto Dyar using an outdoor setting which was unusual at that time. Engstead's creative direction of photographs of actress Louise Brooks led to a promotion to art supervisor, where he oversaw the production of Paramount's publicity stills. In 1932, due to a strike by photographers, Engstead assumed the position of studio portrait photographer, despite having never previously photographed anyone. Actor Cary Grant posed for his practice shots. He returned to his job as art supervisor after the strike was resolved. In 1941, Paramount Pictures fired Engstead, and Harper's Bazaar hired him for freelance advertising and portrait photography assignments. From 1941 to 1949, he took fashion photography assignments from numerous other magazines, including Collier's, Esquire, House Beautiful, Ladies Home Journal, Life, Look, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Vogue, and Women's Home Companion. In the 1940s, Engstead photographed many celebrities, including Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Maureen O'Hara and Shirley Temple. Unlike other photographers, he often shot his subjects at home or outdoors, and his portraits of Judy Garland in Carmel, California were particularly successful. During this decade, he built a studio in Los Angeles that became a gathering place for celebrities.

A native of Canada, Casler married a plumber who opened a plumbing business in Buffalo, New York. Her husband left her behind with two daughters to make his fortune in gold mining. He returned eight years later with only $700, but during those years, Casler had obtained her license as a plumber expert and built a business employing twelve men. In 1921, after her husband died, Casler moved with her daughters to Los Angeles, where she went into business as a builder and developer. In 1931, she recalled, \\\"I put up flat buildings right after the war when no one was risking building anything. I have sixty of them now. Then I had the idea of developing Maple Avenue. My Class A buildings are on Maple -- one for garment manufacturers, one for printing, one for furniture, and they are all full.\\\" Though she joined the real estate development company, Lloyd and Casler, Inc., in 1923, she later went out on her own, preferring to make all decisions herself without partners. Among the buildings she developed is the Textile Center Building, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Upon the opening of the Textile Center Building in 1926, the Los Angeles Times noted that the building was \\\"the outgrowth of an idea born of one of the builders -- Mrs. Frances C. Casler -- who, though only a resident of Los Angeles for ten years, is responsible for the construction of over $7,000,000 worth of property ...\\\" Casler maintained her office at the Textile Center Building during the height of her career. Other buildings developed by Casler include the Allied Crafts Building, the Mac Printing Co. Building, the Bendix Building and the Garment Capitol Building. By 1931, the Los Angeles Times reported that Casler had \\\"eight Class A limit-height buildings to her credit, sixty flat buildings and a vast vision of the future of Los Angeles.\\\" The group Preserve LA has described Casler as \\\"perhaps the only woman involved in heavy construction in Los Angeles at the time.\\\" The Los Angeles Times cautioned the city's businessmen in 1931 not to underestimate \\\"this nice maternal little woman, in a soft green suit, a black and white hat with a feminine white rose beneath its brim.\\\" It also noted: \\\"She seems to be pleasantly unaware what a remarkable little woman she is. She went right along with her plumbing while the babies were coming along and she marvels that there could ever be any discussion as to whether women should try to combine both careers and matrimony. 'I had to,' she laughs, 'so I never thought about it.'\\\" In 2008, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission recognized Casler as \\\"one of the first women in the early 20th century to head a company in the field of development and construction of high-rise buildings.\\\" She was also appointed head of Peoples Bank of Los Angeles, making her the only female director of a bank in Los Angeles.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Architect", "wiki_name": "Florence_Casler", "word_count": 523, "label": "Architect", "people": "Florence Casler"}

{"text": "David Frye (November 21, 1933 \u2013 January 24, 2011) was an American comedian, specializing in comic imitations of famous political figures, most of whom were based on notable Americans, including former U.S. Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, Vice Presidents Spiro Agnew and Nelson Rockefeller, Senators Hubert Humphrey and Bobby Kennedy, as well as film celebrities, e.g., George C. Scott, Henry Fonda, Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, Jack Nicholson and Jack Palance, and media figures, e.g., William F. Buckley Jr. and Larry King. However, as eerily accurate and subtle as his impersonations were, the comedic narratives spoken by those depicted by Frye were outrageously \u00e0 propos as well as politically savvy and au courant. For example, in one narrative, Frye had newly elected Nixon and his wife visit the White House just prior to assuming residency there in 1969. The incumbent Johnson answers the doorbell, oblivious as to the identity of his unannounced visitors, misidentifying them even after introductions have been made: [Doorbell rings]Johnson: \\\"I'll get it, Lady Bird! Who's there?\\\"Nixon: \\\"It's Dick and Pat.\\\"Johnson (shouting): \\\"It's Pick 'n Pat!\\\"Nixon: \\\"No, it's Dick and Pat: The President Elect ... and Mrs. Elect.\\\"Johnson: \\\"I understand.\\\"Johnson (shouting back): \\\"Company, Lady Bird! Beautify yourself!\\\" Another, from a February 1971 appearance on NBC's Kraft Music Hall, had him appearing in two segments. In the first, he portrayed Humphrey as a drug store owner (harkening back to Humphrey's original vocation) being interviewed by show host Eddy Arnold. The latter segment had Frye impersonating Nixon, William F. Buckley, Jr., George Jessel, Truman Capote and Liberace at a Valentine's Day party. Frye's Nixon often keyed off the President's own catchphrases (\\\"Let me make one thing perfectly clear\\\", \\\"Let me say this about that\\\", etc.) In 1973, Frye's album, Richard Nixon: A Fantasy, which dealt with Nixon's Watergate troubles, developed marketing problems when all three network affiliates in New York City (WNBC-TV, WABC-TV and WCBS-TV) rejected commercials promoting the album, citing questions of taste. In addition, the Woolworth's department store chain decided not to stock the record because, in their words, \\\"some of our customers might be offended.\\\" Though his heyday was in the 1960s and early 1970s, when his Lyndon B. Johnson was definitive and he vied with Rich Little as the premier Nixon impersonator, Frye continued to create masterful new impressions and evolve old ones. His 1998 album Clinton: An Oral History featured riffs on Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Pat Buchanan, and John McLaughlin, plus that of an older Nixon (complete with pauses and phrasing more typical of the ex-President as he sounded in the 1980s and 1990s).", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Comedian", "wiki_name": "David_Frye", "word_count": 432, "label": "Comedian", "people": "David Frye"}

Dibnah was born in a country which then relied heavily upon coal to fuel its industry. As a child he was fascinated by the steam engines which powered the many textile mills in Bolton, but he paid particular attention to chimneys and the men who worked on them. He began his working life as a joiner, before becoming a steeplejack. From age 22, he served for two years in the armed forces, as part of his national service. Once demobilised, he returned to steeplejacking but met with limited success until he was asked to repair Bolton's parish church. The resulting publicity provided a welcome boost to his business, ensuring he was almost never out of work. In 1978, while making repairs to Bolton Town Hall, Dibnah was filmed by a regional BBC news crew. The BBC then commissioned an award-winning documentary, which followed the rough-hewn steeplejack as he worked on chimneys, interacted with his family and talked about his favourite hobby\u2014steam. His Lancastrian manner and gentle, self-taught philosophical outlook, proved popular with viewers and he featured in a number of television programmes. Toward the end of his life, the decline of Britain's industry was mirrored by a decline in his steeplejacking business and Dibnah increasingly came to rely on after-dinner speaking for his income. In 1998, he presented a programme on Britain's industrial history and went on to present a number of series, largely concerned with the Industrial Revolution and its mechanical and architectural legacy.

Working in Indianapolis in the 1880s, Bohn entered into a partnership in 1888 with Bernard Vonnegut Sr., WAA (from 1886), and Fellow (from 1889) to form Vonnegut & Bohn. Vonnegut had been practicing with a client roster in Indianapolis since 1883 and had previous draftsman experience in the prominent New York firm of George B. Post. He also came from a wealthy and respected family that may have led to several commissions. However, Vonnegut was not the most sociable individual and was not active in the community, which is where several commissions often originate. In addition, Vonnegut and frequently traveled and lived abroad, so Bohn was likely to have played a significant role in attracting clients and executing much of the day-to-day work, despite being overshadowed by the Vonnegut name. The firm went on to create many landmarks in Indianapolis and greater Indiana, and a number have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places Bernard Vonnegut died young in 1908 and Arthur continued the firm under the same name. Bernard's son, Kurt Vonnegut Sr. returned from Germany in 1910 and became a partner in the firm, which remained named Vonnegut & Bohn, despite Bohn's seniority. While with the firm, he worked as a local supervising architect for Holabird & Roche's The Fletcher Trust Building (after the original designer Electus D. Litchfield was dismissed).

He then studied at the Dresden Academy from 1922\u20131923. During the 1920s his paintings, primarily portraits of working-class subjects, were influenced by the work of Otto Dix. Like his friend Gert Heinrich Wollheim, he often depicted himself in a theatrical manner, as in his Self-Portrait during the Carnival Season (1930). He had his first solo exhibition in 1930 at the Dresden gallery of J\u00f3zef Sandel. He made his first etchings in 1933. Politically anti-fascist, he joined the German Communist Party in 1926, and was a founding member of the arts organization Assoziation revolution\u00e4rer bildender K\u00fcnstler in Dresden in 1929. Following the fall of the Weimar Republic, Grundig was declared a degenerate artist by the Nazis, who included his works in the defamatory Degenerate Art exhibition in Munich in 1937. He expressed his antagonism toward the regime in paintings such as The Thousand Year Reich (1936). Forbidden to practice his profession, he was arrested twice\u2014briefly in 1936, and again in 1938, after which he was interned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940\u20131944. In 1945 he went to Moscow, where he attended an anti-fascist school. Returning to Berlin in 1946, he became a professor of painting at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts.

{"text": "Major Kerby Farrell (September 3, 1913 \u2013 December 17, 1975) was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager. He was a longtime minor league manager who spent but a single season \u2014 1957 \u2014 as a pilot in Major League Baseball. Farrell was a three-time winner of The Sporting News' Minor League Manager of the Year award (1954, 1956 and 1961) \u2014 the only man to have won the award more than twice (as of 2015). Born in Leapwood, McNairy County, Tennessee, Farrell played college baseball at Freed-Hardeman College for two years. In his playing days, he was a first baseman and veteran minor-leaguer who appeared in two full MLB seasons during the World War II manpower shortage, with the 1943 Boston Braves and the 1945 Chicago White Sox, batting .262 with 177 hits, no home runs and 55 runs batted in in 188 games played. He also pitched in five games for the 1943 Braves, losing his only decision and compiling an earned run average of 4.30 in 23 innings of work. He batted and threw left-handed, stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 172 pounds (78 kg). Farrell began his managing career before the war in the Class C Middle Atlantic League in 1941\u201342. In 1947, he became a skipper in the farm system of the Cleveland Indians with the Spartanburg Peaches of the Class B Tri-State League and began a steady rise through the Cleveland organization. His 1953 Reading Indians of the Class A Eastern League won 101 games, while his 1954 and 1956 Indianapolis Indians, then Cleveland's Triple-A club, won American Association pennants and the 1956 Junior World Series. These triumphs earned Farrell his first two managerial awards. At the close of the 1956 season, when the Indians finished as runners-up to the New York Yankees, Cleveland manager Al L\u00f3pez resigned to become the new skipper of the White Sox and Farrell was promoted to succeed him. The 1957 campaign was a star-crossed season for the Indians. Prodigal left-handed pitcher Herb Score, a strikeout king and 20-game winner in 1956, was nearly blinded on May 7 by a line drive off the bat of the Yankees' Gil McDougald, and missed the rest of the campaign. Two other 20-game winners from '56, eventual Hall of Famers Bob Lemon and Early Wynn, slumped to below .500 records. While 1957 saw the debut of Roger Maris, who played for Farrell with Indianapolis, the Indians fell to a 76\u201377 (.497) record and a sixth-place finish, the team changed general managers (from Hank Greenberg to Frank Lane), and Farrell was fired. He then returned to the minors, where he managed in the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets and Minnesota Twins organizations. He also coached for the White Sox (1966\u201369) and Indians (1970\u201371). As a minor league skipper over 21 seasons, Farrell won 1,710 games, losing 1,456 (.540).

{"text": "Gerald M. \\\"Jerry\\\" Reaven (born July 28, 1928 in Gary, Indiana) is an American endocrinologist and professor emeritus in medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine in Stanford, California, United States. Reaven's work on insulin resistance and diabetes with John W. Farquhar goes back at least to 1968. A long-term researcher into diabetes, he achieved significant notability with his 1988 Banting Lecture (organized annually by the American Diabetes Association in memory of Frederick Banting). In his lecture, he propounded the theory that central obesity (male-type or apple-shaped obesity), diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure) have a common cause in insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Initially titled \\\"syndrome X\\\", the constellation of symptoms is now known as the metabolic syndrome and an object of extensive scientific inquiry, especially given that the combination strongly predisposes for cardiovascular disease. Still, Reaven believes that contemporary criteria are arbitrary and that it may not be necessary to define it as a diagnostic entity more than a pathophysiological parameter. He obtained his academic qualifications at the University of Chicago and did his internship there. After research work in Stanford and two years in the U.S. Army medical corps he completed his residency at the University of Michigan. He then took up a US Public Health Service research post at Stanford, where he progressed to a full professorship in 1970. He led endocrinology and gerontology research. Apart from his work at Stanford he is also Senior Vice President for Research for Shaman Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in South San Francisco. He is a member of several research organizations and has received numerous prizes for his research achievements.

He was subsequently recalled by Yulon who initially signed him and allowed him to play for the BoT, and formally became a Yulon Dino.

Listed at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 165 lb., Hamrick batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Nashville, Tennessee. Fast and steady, Hamrick was one of many ballplayers who interrupted their careers to serve during World War II. Hamrick started his professional baseball career as a shortstop and pitcher in 1939, playing for the Nashville, Charleston and Americus Minor league teams. During his stay at Americus, he made the All-Star team in 1941 and batted over a .300 batting average for most of the year. His most productive season came in 1943, when he hit 145 in 460 at-bats with Nashville for a .310 average. Hamrick joined the Philadelphia Phillies in 1943. The following season, he began spring training with the team in Wilmington, Delaware, because the war kept the teams out of Florida for camp due to the submarine threat. Hamrick left spring training as Philadelphia\u2019s starting shortstop, but he left for the military service after appearing in 74 games. With the end of the war, Hamrick rejoined the team (by then the Phillies) in 1946, but the competition for a roster spot was now overwhelming as Skeeter Newsome became the everyday shortstop. In a two-season majors career, Hamrick was a .204 hitter (92-for-452) in 118 games, including 34 runs, 32 RBI, 13 doubles, two triples, one home run and one stolen base. He made 74 appearances at shortstop (86) and second base (31), and posted a collective .946 fielding percentage. After that, Hamrick hit .266 (92-for-346) for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League in 1946, his last professional baseball season.

{"text": "Mava Lee Thomas (September 1, 1929 \u2013 August 6, 2013) was an infielder and catcher who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. She was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. Born in Ocala, Florida, Mava Lee Thomas was the only player in AAGPBL history whose father played in Major League Baseball. Her father, Herb Thomas, was a center fielder/second baseman for the Boston Braves and New York Giants in parts of three seasons spanning 1924\u20131927. In the fourth grade, Thomas learned her baseball skills from her father, who taught her the importance of competition, practice, adversity, and teamwork. \u2032\u2032Tommie\u2032\u2032, as her father dubbed her, attended several schools while growing up in Florida because Mr. Thomas worked as a coach and scout for the Giants organization. She heard about the AAGPBL while attending Ocala High School, where she played for the VFW team. The AAGPBL operated from 1943 to 1954 and gave over 600 women athletes the opportunity to play professional baseball and to play it at a level never before attained. The league was conceived by Philip K. Wrigley during World War II, under the idea of initiating the innovative project to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting major-league rosters of first-line players and attendance declined at ballparks around the country. After graduating from school, Thomas attended an AAGPBL tryout at Fort Wayne, Indiana. The switch-hitter made the grade and joined the Fort Wayne Daisies for the 1951 season. Thomas earned $75 per week plus expenses with the Daisies, which was a considerable amount of money in those days, even though the girls played six nights a week and a doubleheader on Sundays. She was mostly used as a backup for Mary Rountree (C) and Jean Weaver (3B). At the end of the season, Thomas became concerned that poor attendance indicated an uncertain future for the league. Then, she was determined to continue playing ball and went into the US Navy to play in the female softball team, serving also as a member of the Armed Forces Recreation Society. After discharge in 1953, she played exhibition games for the Hagerstown Mollies of Maryland during two years. She got married in 1953, but the marriage lasted only two years. Thomas also finished a degree in recreation at the University of Florida and went to work for the Ocala Parks and Recreation Department in 1984, helping to establish such events as Light Up Ocala and the annual fishing derby at Tuscawilla Park, before retiring in 1995. In 1988, Thomas received further recognition when she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. In addition, Thomas and her father became the only father/daughter combination to be inducted into the Florida Baseball Hall of Fame. The AAGPBL folded in 1954. Lady pitchers, catchers, and fielders drifted into obscurity until 1992 when the film A League of Their Own was released. The film kindled a renewed interest in these trailblazers who have their own places in American history. While the film does not use real names, filmmaker Penny Marshall seemed to be aiming for realism, as her work includes fake newsreel footage and pseudo-documentary present day scenes at the beginning and end of the fictitious story. Since then, Thomas and her teammates have become the darlings of the media. They have been honored several times for their significant contributions, responding to request for autographs and corresponding with young athletes interested in hearing of their days in the AAGPBL. Thomas felt proud to be the only girl ball player with a major league father. She remembered him into playing an old-timers game in 1988 when he was 87 years old. He had spike scars on his arm from Ty Cobb, she explained in an interview. Tommie Thomas died in 2013 in her homeland of Ocala, Florida at the age of 83, following complication from Alzheimer's disease.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "BaseballPlayer", "wiki_name": "Mava_Lee_Thomas", "word_count": 672, "label": "Baseball Player", "people": "Mava Lee Thomas"}

In that capacity, in 1882 he presided over one of the most important cases in the state of that era, in which liquor merchants challenged the enforceability of the 1882 amendment to the Iowa Constitution requiring prohibition. Hayes declared the amendment unconstitutional on procedural grounds, based on the failure of the law to pass both houses of the Iowa General Assembly in identical form. The Iowa Supreme Court affirmed Hayes' ruling, but in the next session the Iowa General Assembly adopted prohibition, by statute, in a constitutional fashion. Hayes served as delegate to the 1884 Democratic National Convention. In 1886, Hayes wrested the Democratic nomination for the 2nd district away from incumbent Jeremiah Henry Murphy. To enhance the chances for Iowa Republicans to hold all other Congressional seats in Iowa, the state's General Assembly had included many of the most Democratic-leaning areas of eastern Iowa in a single district (the second). Hayes won the general election that year and represented the 2nd district in the 50th United States Congress. He was also elected to the three succeeding Congresses. However, in 1894, when seeking a fifth term, Hayes was defeated in the general election by Republican George M. Curtis. Between the Civil War and the Great Depression, Hayes was the only Democratic congressman from Iowa to serve more than two terms, and (along with Murphy) was one of only two who served two full terms. While in Congress, Hayes served as chairman of the Committee on Education in the Fifty-second Congress. In all, he served in Congress from March 4, 1887, to March 3, 1895. After leaving Congress, Hayes resumed the practice of law in Clinton.He served as member of the Iowa House of Representatives in 1897 and 1898. He died in Marshall, Michigan, on March 14, 1901.

In an interview with a photography magazine, Tenneson advised artists: \\\"I very strongly believe that if you go back to your roots, if you mine that inner territory, you can bring out something that is indelibly you and authentic - like your thumbprint. It's going to have your style because there is no one like you.\\\" As a child, her parents worked on the grounds of a convent, which is where she grew up with her two sisters. She and her sister \\\"were enlisted to be in holiday pageants and processions. It was a mysterious environment - something out of Fellini - filled with symbolism, ritual, beauty, and also a disturbing kind of surreal imagery.\\\"  Tenneson moved from Manhattan to Rockport, Maine in 2004. Her work has been displayed in more than 100 exhibitions around the world. Tenneson has had cover images on several magazines including Time, Life, Entertainment Weekly, Newsweek, Premiere, Esquire and The New York Times Magazine.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Photographer", "wiki_name": "Joyce_Tenneson", "word_count": 232, "label": "Photographer", "people": "Joyce Tenneson"}

{"text": "Youssef Zulficar Pasha (6 June 1866 \u2013 after 1952) was an Egyptian judge. He was the father of Queen Farida of Egypt and thus father-in-law of King Farouk I. Youssef Zulficar belonged to a prominent family of Turko-Circassian origin whose ancestors came to Egypt with viceroy Muhammad Ali Pasha at the beginning of the 19th century, and who went on to become part of the country's aristocracy. He was the grandson of Youssef Bey Rasmi, commander of the Egyptian armies in the Abyssinian and Russian Wars. His father was Ali Zulficar, a former Governor of Cairo. Youssef Zulficar obtained a law degree from the Khedivial School in Cairo and entered the judiciary. He became vice-president of the Alexandria Mixed Court of Appeal. Zulficar married Zeinab Sa'id, the daughter of former Prime Minister Muhammad Sa'id Pasha and sister of renowned artist Mahmoud Sa'id. Zeinab served as lady-in-waiting to Queen Nazli. Zulficar and Zeinab had a daughter, Safinaz (born in 1921), as well as two sons, Muhammad Sa'id (born c. 1926) and Sherif (born c. 1931). After her son Farouk ascended the throne as King of Egypt, Queen Nazli urged him to take Zulficar's daughter Safinaz as his wife. Although Zulficar was wary at the prospect of his daughter becoming part of the royal family and feared the outcome of the marriage, the wedding eventually took place. Safinaz became Queen of Egypt and changed her name to Farida when she married King Farouk I on 20 February 1938. Farouk conferred upon Zulficar the nobiliary title of Pasha on 25 August 1937, six months before the wedding ceremony. Upon his daughter's marriage, Zulficar received from the Royal Chamberlain an envelope containing a cheque for 10,000,000 Egyptian piastres (US$257,000), half of the royal dowry. Zulficar was appointed the first Egyptian ambassador to Iran on 13 March 1939. His appointment came after diplomatic relations between the two countries were upgraded to ambassadorial level. He was initially sent to Iran to prepare for the arrival of King Farouk's sister Princess Fawzia, who married Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the then crown prince (later shah) of Iran on 16 March 1939. Following the outbreak of World War II, Zulficar secretly communicated with representatives of the Axis powers in Tehran. King Farouk and many Egyptians at the time sympathized with Nazi Germany in the hope that an Axis victory would put an end to the decades-old British occupation of Egypt. Zulficar informed the German minister plenipotentiary in Tehran of Egypt's goodwill towards Germany and of the king's respect for Adolf Hitler. The most dangerous mission of Zulficar's ambassadorship took place in 1941, when he forwarded to the Germans a letter by King Farouk containing details of the forthcoming Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. In 1942, Zulficar was replaced as Egypt's ambassador to Iran by Abdel Latif Pasha Talaat. He returned to Egypt where he was nominated as a senator in July of the same year. He was renominated as a senator in May 1946. Farouk and Farida's marriage was not successful, and the two divorced in 1948. Four years later, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 toppled King Farouk. Following Farouk's abdication and his departure from Egypt, Zulficar granted interviews to the press in which he talked about his daughter's divorce from the ex-king. This angered Farouk, who stated that \\\"the aged, garrulous father of my first wife [...] in his dotage is apparently now ready to gossip upon intimate family matters with any wandering reporter who cares to rap upon his front door.\\\" Farouk believed the reason Zulficar was talking publicly about the divorce was because he was \\\"no doubt anxious to ingratiate himself with [Egypt's] dangerous new regime.\\\"", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Ambassador", "wiki_name": "Youssef_Zulficar_Pasha", "word_count": 613, "label": "Ambassador", "people": "Youssef Zulficar Pasha"}

He raced in touring cars, Formula Vee and Formula Ford before a period in sports car racing. He subsequently found the finance to buy a seat with Scuderia Finotto driving their Brabham at his home grand prix in 1974, and although he failed to qualify, this led to a contract with Surtees for the last two races of the season. After a good showing at the 1974 Canadian Grand Prix, Koinigg was beginning to establish himself as a good prospect for 1975. But running near the back in the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Koinigg's car suffered a suspension failure at turn 7, pitching it head-on into the Armco barrier. The speed at which Koinigg crashed was relatively minor, and he ought to have escaped the scene uninjured. Unfortunately, as with a number of other circuits at that time, the Armco was insecurely installed and the bottom portion of it buckled as the vehicle struck it.

{"text": "Ed Elisian (born Edward Gulbeng Eliseian; December 9, 1926 Oakland, California \u2013 August 30, 1959 Milwaukee, Wisconsin) was an American racing driver, mainly competing in the National Championship. He died in a crash at the Milwaukee Mile. In the 1955 Indianapolis 500, he stopped his car in a futile attempt to help Bill Vukovich when Vukovich's car crashed and burned during the race. He is one of only two drivers in Indy 500 history to stop a non-damaged car to help another driver, the other being Gary Bettenhausen. He received a sportsmanship award for his efforts, as well as the wrath of the car owner. In June 1956, Elisian was engaging in a wheel-to-wheel duel with Bob Sweikert, who had won the race in which Vukovich was killed, in a Sprint car race at Salem Speedway when Sweikert made contact with the rail, overleapt it and rolled over outside of the track, suffering fatal skull injuries. Elisian was exonerated as no collision had taken place. In the 1958 Indianapolis 500, Dick Rathmann and Elisian started the race on the front row, with Jimmy Reece on the outside of the front row. Elisian spun in Turn 3 of the first lap, and collected Rathmann, sending them both into the wall, and starting a 15-car pileup. According to A. J. Foyt, Pat O'Connor's car hit Reece's car, sailed fifty feet in the air, landed upside down, and burst into flames. Although medical officials said that O'Connor was probably killed instantly from a fractured skull, he was incinerated in the accident, in full view of fans and drivers. Widely blamed for the accident, Elisian was suspended by USAC (reinstated a few days later), and was shunned by the racing community. Rumors spread that Elisian tried to lead the first lap in order to pay gambling debts owed to a syndicate. In June 1958, Elisian collided with Jim Davis in a Sprint car race at New Bremen Speedway in Auglaize County, Ohio. After Davis had run over one of the wheels of Elisian's spinning car when trying to pass him at the south turn, both cars flipped over and slid down the track. Elisian sustained minor injuries, but Davis, who suffered a skull fracture and chest injuries, died at Memorial Hospital in St. Marys, Ohio. While absolved of blame in the incident, Elisian's unpopularity with drivers deepened. In September 1958, Elisian was suspended for being charged with passing fraudulent checks among other things, but reinstated as of end of May 1959. In August 1959, Elisian entered the USAC Indy car 200-mile (320 km) race at the \\\"Milwaukee Mile,\\\" known in those days as Wisconsin State Fair Park. Driving a metallic green Watson-style roadster owned by Ernie Ruiz, he crashed on lap 29 when he spun in oil from A. J. Foyt's engine. The car hit the wall, rupturing the fuel cell, and rolled over. Some sixty gallons of fuel caught fire, and took over nine minutes to extinguish. The crash claimed the life of Elisian.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "RacingDriver", "l3": "FormulaOneRacer", "wiki_name": "Ed_Elisian", "word_count": 501, "label": "Formula One Racer", "people": "Ed Elisian"}

He was commissioned in September 1914 and was appointed to the rank of Temporary Lieutenant in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. He transferred in the same rank to the Royal Engineers on 19 May 1917. Whilst serving with the Royal Engineers, Cronin was awarded the Military Cross in 1918 for gallantry in battle at an unspecified location. He was ordered to follow behind an attacking infantry unit with a section of sappers and to assist with the construction of strongpoints to make the position more defendable. Cronin reached the front with his men and immediately began the construction of field defences despite being under extremely heavy enemy fire from a flank. This fire eventually became so heavy that he halted works and assisted the infantry with the mopping up of enemy resistance. In the course of this Cronin assaulted enemy positions and captured several prisoners of war. He then resumed construction of the defensive works. Cronin's actions were said, in his medal citation, to have \\\"very greatly helped\\\" the success of the attack. After the War, Cronin rose to be Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Water Board.

{"text": "Evaristo Baschenis (December 7, 1617 \u2013 March 16, 1677) was an Italian Baroque painter of the 17th century, active mainly around his native city of Bergamo. He was born to a family of artists. He is best known for still lifes, most commonly of musical instruments. This could explain his friendship with a family with notable violin makers from Cremona. Still-life depiction were uncommon as a thematic among Italian painters prior to the 17th century. Baschenis, along with the more eccentric 16th century painter Milanese Arcimboldo, represents provincial outputs with idiosyncratic tendencies that appear to appeal to the discernment of forms and shapes rather than grand manner themes of religious or mythologic events. For Arcimboldo, the artifice is everything; for Baschenis, the items, man-made musical instruments, have a purpose and a beauty even in their silent geometry. One source for his photographic style of still life could be Caravaggio's early painting of peaches, or alternatively, Dutch paintings. The most faithful imitator of his style is a younger contemporary Bergamese, Bartolomeo Bettera. Baschenis is a contemporary of the Bergamese portrait artist, Carlo Ceresa, and appears to have been influential for the Modenese artist Cristoforo Munari.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Painter", "wiki_name": "Evaristo_Baschenis", "word_count": 194, "label": "Painter", "people": "Evaristo Baschenis"}

He apprenticed initially with Lorenzo di Credi and Antonio del Ceraiolo, but then moved into the studio of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, from whom he acquired the name Michele di Ridolfo or Michele (di Ridolfo) del Ghirlandaio. Tosini began painting in the early 16th-century Florentine style of Fra Bartolommeo and Andrea del Sarto (e.g. the Virgin of the Sacred Girdle, c. 1525; Florence, San Marco). His acceptance of Mannerism was slow, but by the 1540s the influence of Francesco Salviati and Agnolo Bronzino was visible in his work. After 1556, Tosini served as an assistant to Giorgio Vasari in the decoration of the Salone dei Cinquecento in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. Through Vasari's example, Tosini adopted a vocabulary derived from the work of Michelangelo and painted some of his best-known works in this manner (e.g. Night, c. 1560; Rome, Galleria Colonna, and Leda, c. 1560; Rome, Galleria Borghese). He executed several important commissions late in his career: the fresco decoration of three city gates of Florence (1560s), the altar in the chapel at the Villa Caserotta (1561), near San Casciano Val di Pesa, and the paintings on the sides and back of the tabernacle of the high altar of Santa Maria della Quercia (1570), Viterbo.

Born on a farm near Kewaunee, Wisconsin, O'Konski attended the local public schools and the University of Iowa. He graduated from State Teachers College (now University of Wisconsin\u2013Oshkosh) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 1927 and from the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison) in 1932. He was a high school teacher in Omro and Oconto from 1926 to 1929, a member of the faculty of Oregon State College at Corvallis from 1929 to 1931, and a faculty member at the University of Detroit from 1936 to 1938. He was superintendent of schools in Pulaski, Wisconsin from 1932 to 1935 and an instructor at a junior college in Coleraine, Minnesota in 1936. He was an educator, journalist, lecturer, editor and publisher at Hurley, Wisconsin from 1940 to 1942. In 1942, O'Konski was elected as a Republican to the Seventy-eighth Congress. He was then reelected to the fourteen succeeding Congresses serving from January 3, 1943 till January 3, 1973. While in congress, he represented Wisconsin's 10th congressional district. He lost a bid for the Republican senatorial nomination to succeed Joseph McCarthy in 1957. O'Konski represented a district that included much of the northwestern part of the state, including Rhinelander and Superior. However, after the 1970 census, Wisconsin lost a district, and most of O'Konski's territory was merged with Wisconsin's 7th congressional district represented by three-term Democratic Party member Dave Obey. O'Konski retained only about 40 percent of his former territory, a disadvantage he was unable to overcome despite his seniority. Even though Richard Nixon carried most of the district in the 1972 election, O'Konski was defeated. A proposed navy project called Sanguine which O'Konski supported may have been a factor in his loss. While still serving in Congress, O'Konski founded WAEO-TV, the NBC affiliate for most of north-central Wisconsin. He sold the station in 1976; it is now WJFW-TV. O'Konski lived in Kewaunee, Wisconsin until his death in 1987.

{"text": "William Froude (28 November 1810 in Devon \u2013 4 May 1879 in Simonstown, South Africa) was an English engineer, hydrodynamicist and naval architect. He was the first to formulate reliable laws for the resistance that water offers to ships (such as the hull speed equation) and for predicting their stability. Froude was born at Dartington, Devon, England, the son of Robert Froude, Archdeacon of Totnes and was educated at Westminster School and Oriel College, Oxford, graduating with a first in mathematics in 1832. His first employment was as a surveyor on the South Eastern Railway which, in 1837, led to Brunel giving him responsibility for the construction of a section of the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It was here that he developed his empirical method of setting out track transition curves and introduced analternative design to the helicoidal skew arch bridge at Rewe and Cowley Bridge Junction, near Exeter. At Brunel's invitation Froude turned his attention to the stability of ships in a seaway and his 1861 paper to the Institution of Naval Architects became influential in ship design. This led to a commission to identify the most efficient hull shape, which he was able to fulfil by reference to scale models: he established a formula (now known as the Froude number) by which the results of small-scale tests could be used to predict the behaviour of full-sized hulls. He built a sequence of 3, 6 and (shown in the picture) 12 foot scale models and used them in towing trials to establish resistance and scaling laws; Raven's sharp prow followed the \\\"waveline\\\" theory of John Scott Russell, but Swan's blunter profile proved to offer lower resistance. His experiments were vindicated in full-scale trials conducted by the Admiralty and as a result the first ship test tank was built, at public expense, at his home in Torquay. Here he was able to combine mathematical expertise with practical experimentation to such good effect that his methods are still followed today. In 1877, he was commissioned by the Admiralty to produce a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large naval engines. He invented and built the world's first water brake dynamometer, sometimes known as the hydraulic dynamometer, which led to the formation of Heenan & Froude Ltd in Birmingham. He died while on holiday (as an official guest of the Royal Navy) in Simonstown, South Africa, and was buried there with full naval honours. He was the brother of James Anthony Froude, a historian, and Hurrell Froude, writer and priest. William was married to the former Catherine Henrietta Elizabeth Holdsworth, daughter of Dartmouth Governor, mercantile magnate and member of Parliament Arthur Howe Holdsworth.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Engineer", "wiki_name": "William_Froude", "word_count": 445, "label": "Engineer", "people": "William Froude"}

Then he entered into the service of King Louis II of Hungary in Prague and Buda, where he was employed as court portraitist in the years 1522-1526.

Krell was known as the F\u00fcrstenmaler (Painter of Princes) in service of the German Princes - Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach, Duke in Prussia, Hedwig Jagiellon, Electress of Brandenburg and the Elector Augustus of Saxony. Hans Krell is credited by Dieter Koepplin as the author of a painting long associated with Lucas Cranach the Elder or his workshop - Battle of Orsha, painted around 1524-1530. The painting, today displayed in the National Museum in Warsaw, depicts the battle which was fought on 8 September 1514 between the allied forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland and the army of Grand Duchy of Moscow. According to the specialists, the author must have taken part in the battle himself due to high knowledge of the subject. Krell's connections with the Jagiellonian dynasty patrons (including King of Hungary) and rulers of Prussia makes this attribution highly probable.

He is also well known as an illustrator, though he considers himself first and foremost a fashion designer. Vollbracht began his career in fashion as a student at what was then Parsons School of Design in 1965. Four years later, Geoffrey Beene hired him as a member of his design team, and Donald Brooks followed suit two years later. In 1973 he went to work for Henri Bendel as their in-house illustrator. He continued in that function when he moved to Bloomingdale's after another two years, but also designed the store's famous Face Bag, carried out daily by thousands of shoppers. In 1979 he launched his own line, which was received so well that it earned him the Coty Award the very next year. The company folded in 1985 due to Vollbracht having accepted financial backing from Johnny Carson, which was withdrawn during Carson's bitter divorce from his third wife. Afterwards, Vollbracht published Nothing Sacred, a visual diary of his years in New York City and the many people he interacted with, and then moved to Florida to concentrate on his illustrations and art. In 1989, The New Yorker named him one of its top illustrators, and he would produce covers and other art for the next several years. In 1999, Vollbracht returned to the world of fashion after Bill Blass, a longtime friend and mentor, asked him to design a retrospective on Blass's work for Indiana University's art museum. The retrospective, curated by Kathleen Rowold, opened in 2002 after Blass's death. In 2003, Vollbracht returned to New York when he was invited to become head designer for Bill Blass Limited.

{"text": "Adel Sellimi (was born on 16 November 1972 in the Bab Jedid district of Tunis. As a child, he drew inspiration from the 1978 World Cup team who became the first African nation to win a World Cup match. At the age of 10, he joined his first club, Club Africain of Tunis, and he stayed there for the next 14 years, picking up two Tunisian league titles and one Tunisia Cup along the way. His quick pace, strength on the ball and creativity earned him a call-up to the national team, and he earned his first cap in September 1993, during a match against Germany. Following a promising performance he carved out a virtually permanent place for himself in the country's national team for the next eleven years. Tunisians grew to appreciate his discretion in life outside football as a modest and determined professional. On the pitch, he singularly distinguished himself at international level during the 1996 African Cup of Nations finals in South Africa as one of the best players of the tournament. Sellimi became a household name throughout the country, a skillful and talented bright spark who carried the team to the final of the tournament for the second time in their history. Sellimi struck twice in the semi-final against Zambia, and was widely considered one of the best players in the tournament. This movement into the limelight earned the player a transfer to French Ligue 1 side FC Nantes Atlantique, following another impressive showing at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. But his move to France marked the start of a long barren period. Although the Nantes fans dubbed him \\\"The Lung\\\" on account of the distance he clocked up during matches, he never really settled in at his new club. He hit just two goals in 30 appearances in his first season, and failed to achieve the kind of success he had enjoyed back home in Tunisia. After another disappointing season in 1997/98, Sellimi left Nantes for Spanish second division side Real Ja\u00e9n. It was here that he got some first-class matches, and finally found form. This surge in form earned him a call-up to the 1998 World Cup squad, where he put in steady performances against England and Romania. Bundesliga side Freiburg took a gamble on Sellimi and partnered the player with other Tunisian internationals, anchorman Zoubeir Baya and fellow striker Mehdi Benslimane. But here too he took a long time finding his true form, and many at Freiburg considered him a mistaken purchase during his first year. However, he proved his detractors wrong in the best possible way in the 1999/2000 season. Sellimi just could not stop scoring goals and even headed the Bundesliga's goalscoring list going into the winter break. A disappointing 2001 lead to Sellimi missing out on the 2002 African Cup of Nations in Mali and a number of international friendlies after a fall-out with former national coach Henri Michel. But the Frenchman's replacement with Ammar Souayah coupled with the national team's goal drought brought about his recall. The 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan turned out to be Adel Sellimi's swansong in premier football competitions, and he retired from international football shortly after the tournament at the age of 31. He returned to Club Africain shortly afterwards, and is now Head Coach of Jendouba Sport in Tunisia, recently gaining promotion to Ligue 1.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "SoccerPlayer", "wiki_name": "Adel_Sellimi", "word_count": 568, "label": "Soccer Player", "people": "Adel Sellimi"}

His existence in the program was kept secret until the advent of Soviet glasnost in the late 1980s. He committed suicide on February 18, 1966. Born in Porfiryevka, Crimea in USSR, Nelyubov was a captain and pilot in the Soviet Air Force. He was selected as one of the original 20 cosmonauts on March 7, 1960 along with Yuri Gagarin. The following year, six of the original twenty were evaluated for assignment on Vostok flight crews between January 17 and 18; Gagarin, Titov, and Nelyubov were considered the top three candidates. For Vostok 1 Nelyubov was chosen as second backup for Gagarin and presumably first backup for Vostok 2 for Titov in April and August 1961 respectively. For the dual launches of Vostok 3 and Vostok 4, Nelyubov was again chosen as a backup for Andrian Nikolayev and Pavel Popovich. On March 27, 1963, Nelyubov, Ivan Anikeyev and Valentin Filatyev were arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct by the militia at Chkalovskaya station. According to reports, the officers of the security patrol that arrested them were willing to ignore the whole incident if the cosmonauts apologized, but Nelyubov refused, and the matter was reported to the authorities. Because there were previous incidents, all three were dismissed from the cosmonaut corps on April 17, 1963, though officially not until May 4, 1963. Nelyubov never completed a space mission. Following dismissal he went back to flying interceptors in Siberia but fell to drinking and depression. He died on February 18, 1966. While drunk, he stepped in front of a train near the Ippolitovka station, northwest of Vladivostok. It was officially ruled a suicide. To protect the image of the space program, efforts were made to cover up the reason for Nelyubov's dismissal and his following suicide. His image was airbrushed out of the famous \\\"Sochi Six\\\" photo which showed the top members of the original class of Soviet cosmonauts. This airbrushing led to speculation about \\\"lost cosmonauts\\\".", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Astronaut", "wiki_name": "Grigori_Nelyubov", "word_count": 362, "label": "Astronaut", "people": "Grigori Nelyubov"}

He was educated at the grammar school and University of Edinburgh. Early in life he was an officer in the army. Having wasted his own fortune and that of his wife, a descendant of the Adair family, he became an officer in the revenue department at Edinburgh and was later appointed surgeon's mate of the Porcupine sloop of war, bound to the Leeward Islands. Shortly thereafter, he returned to England and soon decided to proceed to Antigua, where he became assistant to a relative, and began to study the medical profession. He also undertook the management of an estate on Antigua, becoming familiar with the condition of the slaves. Although he was anxious for the improvement of the conditions of the slaves, he was opposed to emancipation. He published a tract in 1789 on the subject of the abolition of slavery, in which he tried to depict the real state of slavery in the West Indies, the probable consequences of the abolition of the slave trade; to point out some grievances of the slave, the means by which they might be relieved, and, he added, the necessary regulations of the hospital for the management of the sick. He held that humanity to slaves and religious instruction were the only securities upon which the West India planter could safely rely. His own conduct towards slaves was very kind. He protected and nurtured them as his own children, and they were friendly in return. In a few years he left the West Indies, took a voyage to America, and made the acquaintance of Benjamin Franklin. After a tour in the United States, he returned to Edinburgh, took his degree of M.D., and then settled as a physician at Andover, in Hampshire. After the war with America had commenced, he returned to the West Indies on short notice, at the request of a friend. Upon his arrival he was appointed physician to Monk's Hill and to the commander-in-chief of the troops, and also as one of the assistant judges of the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas. At this time he adopted the name of Adair, having become the next male heir to the estate of his mother's family. In 1783 he left the West Indies, returned to England, and settled at Bath, where he became in volved in many disputes with his professional colleagues and others. These arose partly from his determined opposition to quacks and quackery\u2014his attempts to expose and suppress quackery may be seen as quixotic, but they were no less laudable. His temper was, however, altogether unfit for the warfare which he brought about.

He was, however, a man of an affectionate nature, and endowed with lively sensibility.

As a youth, Peden was a natural athlete, participating in several sports, and was nationally ranked in swimming. He took up bicycle racing in 1925 and trained intensively for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. He was selected for the Canadian team and competed in three Olympic events. Afterward, he remained in Europe to join the cycling circuit. In 1929, he returned to Canada. After winning five titles at the indoor Canadian championships in Montreal, he turned professional. He discovered and excelled at six-day racing. During the Great Depression, the sport was cheap for spectators and very popular. Beginning in 1929, he won 24 of 48 races over the next four years. In 1932, he set a record that still stands: 10 victories. At times, he teamed up with his younger brother Doug (the sport used two-man teams). Overall, he won 38 of 148, a record unbroken until 1965. In 1931, he set a record; riding behind a car providing a shield against the wind, he achieved a speed of 73.5 miles per hour (118.3 km/h). He also coached the 1932 national cycling team and the 1936 track team. He was a showman, popular with the fans. He would grab a scarf or hat from a spectator and ride around with it for a few laps before returning it to its owner. The redhead acquired the nickname \\\"Torchy\\\" when a journalist described him as a \\\"flame-haired youth leading the pack like a torch\\\". He was rumoured to have earned $50,000 a year, an enormous sum at the time. (For comparison, Babe Ruth made $80,000 in 1930.) During the Second World War, he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He participated in his last six-day race in 1942 and his last professional cycling race in 1948.

She was also a graduate and educator, a business owner, a chef, and an author. Wakefield was educated at Framingham State Normal School Department of Household Arts in 1924. Then, she worked as a dietitian and lectured about foods. In 1928, she and her husband Kenneth Donald Wakefield (1897\u20131997) had a son, Kenneth Donald Wakefield Jr. In 1930, she and her husband bought a tourist lodge (the Toll House Inn) in the town of Whitman, Massachusetts in Plymouth County. Located about halfway between Boston and New Bedford, it was a place where passengers had historically paid a toll, changed horses and ate home home-cooked meals. When the Wakefields opened their business, they named the establishment the Toll House Inn. Ruth cooked and served all the food and soon gained local fame for her lobster dinners and desserts. The restaurant had many visitors, including Massachusetts' Senator John F. Kennedy. Her chocolate chip cookies soon became very popular. She invented chocolate chip cookies around 1938. It is often incorrectly reported that the cookie was an accident, and that Wakefield expected the chocolate chunks to melt making chocolate cookies. In reality, Wakefield stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, \\\"We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie.\\\" Wakefield wrote a best selling cookbook, Toll House Tried and True Recipes, that went through 39 printings starting in 1930. The 1938 edition of the cookbook was the first to include the recipe for a chocolate chip cookie, the \\\"Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie\\\". During WWII, US soldiers from Massachusetts who were stationed overseas shared the cookies they received in care packages from back home with soldiers from other parts of the US. Soon, hundreds of soldiers were writing home asking their families to send them some Toll House cookies, and Wakefield was soon inundated with letters from around the world requesting her recipe. Thus began the nationwide craze for the chocolate chip cookie. As the popularity of the Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie increased, the sales of Nestl\u00e9's semi-sweet chocolate bars also spiked. Andrew Nestl\u00e9 and Ruth Wakefield made a business arrangement: Wakefield gave Nestl\u00e9 the right to use her cookie recipe and the Toll House name for one dollar and a lifetime supply of Nestl\u00e9 chocolate. Nestl\u00e9 began marketing chocolate chips to be used especially for cookies and printing the recipe for the Toll House Cookie on its package.

His first Edinburgh Festival Fringe show, Purist, won generally very positive reviews, including four stars from comedy website Chortle, and The Independent newspaper. Delaney had two of his gags included in the top ten of the third annual Dave Award for the Funniest Joke of the Fringe, the only comedian to do so. Following an increased profile due to appearances on Mock the Week and Dave's One Night Stand, Delaney toured Purist in 2013. In July 2012 he appeared on Mock the Week.

He eventually joined Chesterfield in 1929 and in his only season there scored nine times in fourteen games. He moved on from Chesterfield to Tottenham Hotspur in June 1930 and spent seven seasons with the club, and was a prolific goalscorer, hitting 138 goals in 198 matches for Tottenham as they were promoted to the First Division and becoming the club's top scorer for five consecutive seasons, from 1931\u201332 through to 1935\u201336. He also won three caps for England during this time, scoring one goal. His scoring form attracted the attention of Spurs' neighbours and rivals Arsenal, who signed him in 1937, making him the first player to move directly from Spurs to Arsenal since the latter club's move to Highbury in 1913. Intended as a replacement for Ted Drake (who was injured at the time), Hunt made his debut against Manchester City on 2 October 1937 at Highbury, having coincidentally played there for Spurs in a reserve match three days earlier, on 29 September. In 1937\u201338, Hunt played 21 matches (18 in the league) for Arsenal and earned a First Division winners' medal; however, he only scored three goals and was sold to Bolton Wanderers in the summer of 1938 after Drake's recovery, and to make way for the subsequent signing of Bryn Jones.

Commentating at one such PCA event, Maurice Ashley described Vyzmanavin in predatory terms\u2014\\\"He's a dangerous one, the V-man, looking like a cat, ready to pounce.\\\" His highest Elo rating was 2620 and he ceased playing around 1997. Vyzmanavin's early death, aged 40, was officially described as being caused by a heart attack. He lived alone, but had been out with friends in Moscow on 6 January 2000 (the Russian Christmas) and his body was discovered some six days later. There were also reports of poverty and depression. Grandmaster Alexander Baburin believes that there had been serious problems with drinking, which had worsened following the breakdown of his marriage.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "ChessPlayer", "wiki_name": "Alexey_Vyzmanavin", "word_count": 423, "label": "Chess Player", "people": "Alexey Vyzmanavin"}

(May 1, 1865 \u2013 March 3, 1933) was a Canadian born surgeon, humanitarian and Presbyterian missionary who founded a medical mission in Miraj, India in 1894 and led it for nearly 40 years. As part of this mission, Dr.Wanless founded India's first missionary medical school in 1897, and helped to establish a leprosy sanatorium as well as a tuberculosis hospital, now known as the Wanless Chest Hospital. His medical mission turned the once-small village of Miraj into a major medical center in India. By the time he retired in 1928, the clinic he started had become a 250-bed hospital with several important adjuncts. He is considered by many to be India's most famous surgeon of the 19th century, and was known throughout Asia, personally treating princes, rajahs and Mahatma Gandhi. In 1928, he was knighted by King George V, who appointed him Knight Bachelor of the British Empire, for treating 1,000,000 patients and restoring sight to 12,000 of them.

He represented his country at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada. He was forecast, with Daniel Willems, to be the successor to Eddy Merckx. De Wolf seemed to fulfill that promise by winning the 1980 Giro di Lombardia and the 1981 Milan\u2013San Remo, the last and first classic of the season. He almost won the 1982 Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge, beaten by Italian Silvano Contini in the final sprint. After winning a stage in the 1984 Tour de France, his career faded. He helped his teammate Eddy Planckaert win the green jersey in the 1988 Tour de France. He ended his career in 1990. He now helps his wife in her funeral parlour in Dworp, in the south of Brussels. Although he won the Omloop Het Volk two times, De Wolf was an atypical Flemish cyclist, preferring Italian races such as Milan\u2013San Remo to Paris\u2013Roubaix, Gent\u2013Wevelgem and the Tour of Flanders. He was at ease in hilly races, though he was not an impressive climber.

{"text": "Jay Dee \\\"B.J.\\\" Penn (born December 13, 1978) is an American professional mixed martial artist and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner. Penn debuted and competed in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), and later in K-1. Prior to fighting for the UFC, he became the first American Gold medalist of the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship. In mixed martial arts, Penn has competed in the Featherweight, Lightweight, Welterweight, Middleweight, and Heavyweight divisions. As a former UFC Lightweight Champion and UFC Welterweight Champion, he is only the second fighter in UFC history to win titles in multiple weight classes. Penn was also a Co-champion in the UFC 41 Lightweight Tournament, due to an eventual draw opposite Caol Uno in the tournament finale. Through his tenures as champion, Penn unofficially unified the UFC Lightweight Championship (against Sean Sherk) and broke the all-time lightweight title defense record. Penn was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame, as the inaugural inductee in the Modern-Era Wing by career-long rival Matt Hughes, during International Fight Week in July 2015. During his reign, Penn holds the distinction of being undefeated as a Lightweight for over eight years, spanning a nine-fight unbeaten streak in the division. He emerged as one of the top pound-for-pound mixed martial artists in the world early in his career (a recognition he would hold until his initial retirement from the sport), defeating opponents that included Din Thomas, Caol Uno, Paul Creighton, and Matt Serra. Penn soon-after secured his initial world title with K-1, submitting Takanori Gomi for the Rumble on the Rock Lightweight Championship. He immediately ascended into the Welterweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, submitting long-reigning then-champion Matt Hughes to capture the UFC Welterweight Championship, which was eventually relinquished due to contract disputes. Penn therefore departed from the promotion to compete exclusively for K-1. He submitted Duane Ludwig and defeated Rodrigo Gracie and Renzo Gracie before eventually re-signing with the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Following contentious losses to Georges St-Pierre and Matt Hughes, Penn returned to the Lightweight division to submit both Jens Pulver and Joe Stevenson en route to claiming the vacant UFC Lightweight Championship. He made a record three subsequent title defenses; defeating uncrowned champion Sean Sherk and challengers Kenny Florian and Diego Sanchez before losing his title to Frankie Edgar in a disputed decision. In the sunset of his career, Penn returned as a Welterweight to successfully complete his trilogy with Matt Hughes, before retiring between two losses and a draw in attempts to regain the UFC Welterweight Championship. In pursuit of a career resurgence with a descent into the Featherweight division, Penn conclusively announced his retirement following another loss to Frankie Edgar. UFC President, Dana White credits Penn as the man who brought the lower weight divisions into the mainstream of mixed martial arts; claiming Penn to be \\\"the first crossover pay-per-view star for the Ultimate Fighting Championship's lighter weight divisions\\\", as well as that \\\"[through his] accomplishments, B.J. Penn built the 155-pound division\\\". Credited as the greatest Lightweight combatant in mixed martial arts history, Penn's domination of the division, as well as his performances in higher weight classes have him regarded as one of the greatest fighters in the history of the sport.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "MartialArtist", "wiki_name": "B.J._Penn", "word_count": 531, "label": "Martial Artist", "people": "B.J.

With writer Dale Maharidge, he is co-author of the book And Their Children After Them, which won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1990. That book, and another written with Maharidge, Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass, were produced while both men were on the staff of the Sacramento Bee. Singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen credited Journey to Nowhere as an inspiration for two songs from his album The Ghost of Tom Joad, \\\"Youngstown\\\" and \\\"The New Timer\\\". The book was re-released in 1995 with a foreword by Springsteen. Other books by Maharidge and Williamson are: \\\"The Last Great American Hobo\\\" (1993), \\\"Homeland\\\", and \\\"Denison, Iowa\\\". In 1993, Williamson became a staff photographer for the Washington Post. Photos he took on assignment in Kosovo, along with the work of Post colleagues Carol Guzy and Lucian Perkins, led to Williamson's share of another Pulitzer in 2000. That same year, he was named Photographer of the Year by the White House News Photographer's Association. Orphaned at an early age, Williamson grew up in a series of foster homes, a circumstance to which he attributes his interest in the poor and the downtrodden.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Photographer", "wiki_name": "Michael_Williamson_(photographer)", "word_count": 206, "label": "Photographer", "people": "Michael Williamson"}
